Music Director,https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/biographies/pso-conductors/honeck-manfred,"You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released.
Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s
          leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations
          receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the
          Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the
          2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home
          and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural
          ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include
          Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major
          venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg
          Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival,
          Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads
          the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour,
          starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the
          prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus.
Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively
          documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring
          works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss,
          Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding
          reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the
          orchestra won the GRAMMY® for ""Best Orchestral Performance"" in 2018.
          The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with
          Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical
          acclaim.
Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the
          University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a
          member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna
          State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a
          conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination
          to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his
          conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of
          the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the
          Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize
          in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of
          the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian
          National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic
          Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the
          Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he
          was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra,
          following decades of close collaboration.
Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his
          four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he
          conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss,
          Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses
          such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la
          Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg
          Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new
          staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In
          autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, 
          leading a revival of Mozart’sIdomeneo. Beyond the
          podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites,
          including Janáček’sJenůfa, Strauss’sElektra, Dvořák’sRusalkaas
          well as Puccini'sTurandotwhich he regularly performs around the
          globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’sSalome, was premiered
          by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023.
As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading
          international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,
          Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig,
          Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw
          Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di
          Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States,
          he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York
          Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los
          Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony
          Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic
          Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty
          years.
In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging
          programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all
          four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will
          return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony,
          Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and
          Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's
          anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on
          the music of this composer.
Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in
          the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by
          the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International
          Classical Music Awards declared him ""Artist of the Year"".

President & CEO,https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/web/about-landing/melia-p-tourangeau-president,"You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released.
Melia Tourangeau began her tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra when she was appointed President & CEO in May of 2015, the first woman and the youngest CEO in the Symphony’s 124-year history. Tourangeau’s personal and professional commitment to creating deep and meaningful connections between music, musicians and the community is a hallmark of her leadership of the Pittsburgh Symphony, one of America’s most distinguished orchestras.
Soon after her arrival, Tourangeau led the revival of a strategic planning process that has heightened the orchestra’s artistic excellence with innovative concerts, partnerships, premieres, and debuts; moved the organization toward financial stability, including growing the annual fund by 17%; fostered closer cooperation between the board, musicians, staff and volunteers; and deepened the orchestra’s community relationships and reach with new programming and digital technology. She is currently leading a new initiative to promote diversity and inclusion across the organization, with patrons, and with the community. Under Tourangeau’s leadership, the Pittsburgh Symphony has extended the contract of its Music Director, Manfred Honeck, welcomed ten new musicians to the Orchestra and brought new distinguished members of the community to the Board. She successfully led negotiations for a new contract with members of the Orchestra. Tourangeau has represented the orchestra on several highly acclaimed domestic and international tours, enhancing the orchestra’s international reputation. During her tenure, the orchestra’s illustrious recording history has been underscored with numerous GRAMMY Awards and nominations, including the award for Best Orchestral Performance in 2018.
Tourangeau came to the Pittsburgh Symphony from the Utah Symphony | Utah Opera (USUO) in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she served as President & CEO beginning April 2008. Prior to the USUO, Tourangeau worked for the Grand Rapids Symphony in Michigan, beginning as education director in January 1997, being promoted to director of operations in 1999, then vice president and general manager before being named CEO in 2005. Prior to that, she was the education coordinator at the Akron Symphony Orchestra.
She received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1994 from the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music with a major in piano performance and a minor in musicology. In April 2007, she received a master’s degree in public administration with an emphasis on nonprofit leadership from Grand Valley State University.
Tourangeau is a member of and serves on the Board of the Pittsburgh Chapter of Young Presidents Organization (YPO) and the Pittsburgh Forum of International Women’s Forum. She and her husband, Michael, live in the northern suburbs of Pittsburgh with their two children.
