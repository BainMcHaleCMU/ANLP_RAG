Your opera journey begins today!
Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like...
Come as you are or glam it up!
On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable!
Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman)
Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn!
There are even discounts forgroups of 6+,students,20-Something Tuesdaysand more.
English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word!
Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings?
Operas have these in spades! That's why the term ""operatic"" has come to mean ""dramatic to the nth degree.""

These two will slice your notions of ""boring"" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman)
Operas come in all shapes and sizes!
The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under ""Details and Resources."" Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way.
Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too!
While almost all operas make use of ""classical voice technique,"" which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop!
We Shall Not Be Movedlays down fresh beats (Video credit: RLG Creations)
Some playful 18th century coluratura from Semele (Video credit: RLG Creations)
Some rousing 19th century bravado from Carmen (Video credit: RLG creations)
A jazzy number from Charlie Parker's Yardbird (Video credit: RLG Creations)
You don’t need to study before you go to the opera any more than you have to study before you go to a movie!
Opera is a performing art meant to be enjoyed as is. For people who want to familiarize themselves with the plot in advance, there is a synopsis on the opera’s webpage and program books. And if you want to nerd out you can go to thePre Opera Talk,Meet The Artists, or pick up aStudy Guideat our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening!
Not so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too.
While there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones!
Who doesn't love a happy ending? (Photo credit: David Bachman)

Pittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by:
The current leader of Pittsburgh Opera isChristopher Hahn, who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company’s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera’s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded theResident Artist Programto include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move toBitz Opera Factoryin the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there.
Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director,Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company’s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note.
Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here.
Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh’s Tuesday Musical Club (pianistVirginia C. Byerly; contraltoCarolyn Hunt Mahaffey;Priscilla W. Collins;Ruby N. Wickersham; andMarie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States.
The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, wasThe Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The company’s first conductor,Richard Karpof Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company’s move to Heinz Hall in 1971.
In 1983,Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera.
Mark Weinstein’s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company’s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the company’s assets threefold and cemented the Opera’s reputation as a leader in financial management in the region.
Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 andJohn Maucerias Music Director in 2001.
In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current andpermanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Company’s mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011.
In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in itseducational eventsannually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh OperaResident Artist Programis among the country’s top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly designed administrative and rehearsal space provides for events ranging from free communitySong Shop Concertsto concert recitals by world-class opera singers.
Pittsburgh Opera’s long-standing commitment to artistic excellence, responsible fiscal management and good neighborship will continue to prove a valuable asset to the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region for years to come.

Since our founding in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera has enriched the Pittsburgh region by bringing live, world-class opera to our community. We have long been committed to making opera accessible to a diverse audience, but we recognize that a more focused outlook is necessary to ensure that our organization reflects the ideals of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA), in our public offerings as well as internally.
Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect - respect for all stories, voices, experiences, and contributions. We aim to reflect this culture both through our leadership structure, programming choices, and employment policies, as well as through our interactions with our audience and the larger community.
We recognize and celebrate the rich cultural history of opera while also acknowledging that the classic repertoire is largely European and does not include the perspective or experience of many marginalized communities. Because of this history, it has been especially essential that Pittsburgh Opera recognizes these biases and continues to bring more diverse voices both to our stage and to our staff. For many years, Pittsburgh Opera has provided a platform for contemporary works on the main stage as well as part of our Second Stage Project. Through world premieres such as 2017’sThe Summer King, about baseball legend Josh Gibson, and productions ofAs Oneand27, we continue to showcase work by diverse composers and librettists, sung by diverse artists, and supported by a diverse artistic and administrative staff.
In addition, Pittsburgh Opera embraces a continued commitment to growth and conversation, as outlined by the following principles:

She lived for art. Would she die for love?When painter Cavaradossi—the lover of Rome’s enchanting diva Floria Tosca—decides to harbor a fugitive of the law, he makes himself and his beloved Tosca a target of the corrupt Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Now it is up to Tosca to free both her lover and herself from Scarpia’s clutches by making a horrific bargain that will have consequences for them all.Puccini’s whirlwind political thriller packs high romance, dark motives, love, betrayal, murder, and intrigue all into a plot that unfolds over only 24 hours. See why Tosca is one of the most powerful operas ever written.These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

ACT I.Cesare Angelotti, an escaped political prisoner, rushes into the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle to hide. As he slips into the Attavanti family chapel, a Sacristan shuffles in, praying at the sound of the afternoon bells. Painter Mario Cavaradossi enters to work on his portrait of Mary Magdalene. Looking at the portrait, he compares her blond beauty to that of his raven-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca (“Recondita armonia”). The Sacristan grumbles disapproval and leaves. Angelotti emerges from his hiding place and is recognized by his friend and fellow liberal Mario, who gives him food and hurries him back into the chapel as Tosca is heard calling outside. Tosca asks suspiciously why the doors to the church were locked and then reminds him of their rendezvous that evening at his villa (“Non la sospiri la nostra casetta?”). Suddenly recognizing the woman in the painting, Tosca is instantly jealous, but Mario reassures her (“Qual’ occhio al mondo”). When she has gone, Mario summons Angelotti from the chapel; a cannon signals that the police have discovered the escape, so the two flee to Mario's villa. Meanwhile, the Sacristan returns with the choir that is to sing a Te Deum that day. Their excitement is silenced by the entrance of Baron Scarpia, chief of the secret police, in search of Angelotti. When Tosca returns, Scarpia shows her a fan he found in Mario’s work space. Thinking Mario faithless, Tosca tearfully vows vengeance and leaves as the church fills with worshipers. Scarpia, sending his men to follow her to Angelotti, schemes to get the diva in his power (“Va, Tosca!”).

ACT II.In the Farnese Palace, Scarpia anticipates the sadistic pleasure of bending Tosca to his will (“Ha più forte sapore”). The spy Spoletta arrives. He has not found Angelotti, but has arrested Mario, and brings him in for Scarpia to interrogate while Tosca is heard singing a cantata at a royal gala downstairs. She enters just as her lover is being taken to an adjoining room; he will be forced to confess under torture. Unnerved by Scarpia's questioning and the sound of Mario's screams, Tosca reveals Angelotti's hiding place. Mario is brought in; realizing what has happened, he turns on her, but Sciarrone rushes in to announce that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo, a defeat for Scarpia's side. Mario shouts his defiance of tyranny (“Vittoria!”) and is dragged to prison. Scarpia now suggests that Tosca yield herself to him in exchange for her lover's life. Fighting off his embraces, she protests her fate to God, having dedicated her life to art and love (“Vissi d’arte”). Scarpia again insists, but Spoletta interrupts: faced with capture, Angelotti has killed himself. Tosca, forced to give in or lose her lover, agrees to Scarpia's proposition. The baron pretends to order a mock execution for Mario, after which he is to be freed; Spoletta leaves. As Scarpia finishes signing a safe-conduct document for the lovers, Tosca snatches a knife from the table and kills him, then wrenches the safe-conduct pass from the dead man’s hand.

ACT III.The voice of a shepherd boy is heard as church bells toll at dawn. Mario awaits execution at the Castel Sant'Angelo; he bribes the jailer to convey a farewell note to Tosca. Writing it, overcome with memories of love, he gives way to despair (“E lucevan le stelle”). Suddenly Tosca arrives, filled with the story of her recent adventures. Mario caresses the hands that committed murder for his sake, and the two anticipate a brighter future. As the firing squad appears, the diva coaches Mario on how to fake his death convincingly; the soldiers fire and depart. Tosca urges Mario to hurry, but when he fails to move, she discovers that Scarpia's treachery has transcended the grave—the bullets were real. When Spoletta rushes in to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she cries to Scarpia to meet her before God, then leaps to her death.

In April 2008, Pittsburgh Opera moved into its new home at 2425 Liberty Avenue in the Strip District. The building not only has a deep connection to Pittsburgh’s storied past – it was built as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in 1869 – but gives Pittsburgh Opera a bright future.
In 2021, in grateful recognition ofFrancois Bitz's exceptional generosity and long affiliation with the company, Pittsburgh Opera was proud to re-name its headquarters in the Strip District, theBitz Opera Factory.
At 45,000 square feet, the $8 million project features offices, 4,000 square feet of rehearsal spaces, costume, wig, and makeup shops, and a kitchen, meeting the “multimedia” requirements of opera. The renovation resulted in Silver-level LEED certification in the Operations and Maintenance category in June 2011, and incorporates the site’s exposed brick interiors, 150 historically-accurate windows and original metal fire safes.Pittsburgh Opera’s building was designed byIKM. A new wrap-around metal, neon, and LEED sign was designed byBill Kolano. Contractor isMassaro Corporation.
The Bitz Opera Factory is the original home of the George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory. The air brake revolutionized railroad transportation.
Guests enter the Bitz Opera Factory through this casual, welcoming lobby.
The ""Garage"" Conference room has corrugated siding and a clear glass garage door entry.
The George R. White Opera Studio is the home of many of our community events, including Brown Bag concerts.
Our Five Founders are honored with a memorial plaque in our most-used public space.
Our Wardrobe department stores everything from shoes to corsets to scarves to jewelry, and manufactures costumes when needed.
The wig and makeup area, located within the Wardrobe department.
The Library holds a treasure trove of books, scores, libretti, recordings, industry magazines, and more.
