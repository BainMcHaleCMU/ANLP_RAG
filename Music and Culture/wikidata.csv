Pittsburgh Symphony,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra,"
ThePittsburgh Symphony Orchestra(PSO) is an American orchestra based inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The orchestra is resident atHeinz Hall, located in Pittsburgh'sCultural District.  Since 2008, the orchestra's music director isManfred Honeck.  The orchestra's current president andCEOis Melia Tourangeau.
The orchestra was founded by the Pittsburgh Arts Society with conductorFrederic Archerin 1895, who brought with him a number of musicians from theBoston Symphony Orchestraand led the PSO in its first concert the following year.
In 1898,Victor Herbertwas chosen to lead the orchestra.[1]The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing inBoston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada.[2]Its personnel included such musicians asLuigi von Kunits(later the first conductor of theToronto Symphony Orchestra) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg,[3]second violinistJohn Stepan Zamecnik, assistant principal celloGaston Borch, Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.[4]
Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: hisSuite romantiqueop. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra)[5]and thetone poemHero and Leanderop. 33.[6]Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of thePan-American Expositionat the 1901 World's Fair inBuffalo, New York, for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled ""Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique"" for the Orchestra to perform.[7]His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him.[8]
When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductorEmil Paur.  Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics.  Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both theBoston Symphony Orchestraand theNew York Philharmonic, as well as guest conductor throughout Europe,[9]and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards.  Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works byJohannes Brahms, whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.[10]Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur's third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra:
Paur remained at the head of the orchestra until it disbanded in 1910.
In the interim, concert promoterMay Beeglefounded the Pittsburgh Orchestra Association to bring other musical performers to the city.[12][13]
Antonio Modarelli, an American conductor and composer, became conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphonic Orchestra in 1930.[14]A German newspaper described his conducting as ""forceful, authentic, modern music"",[15]and he was invited to conduct in Moscow. He had taught at Duquesne University and been a band leader in the Navy prior to his work in Europe and with the Symphony.[16][17][18]
This program of frequent guest conductors was made in an effort to restore the symphony to its ""golden years,"" but in effect demoted Modarelli, who was finally asked by the Board to resign in 1936.[19]
Otto Klempererwas responsible for bringing in much new talent while working with theMusicians' Unionto hire both local and imported performers.[20]Since then, the orchestra has experienced ongoing growth and development, including building a substantial endowment fund.[citation needed]
Fritz Reinerwas music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1938 to 1948.  Reiner studied with Hungarian composerBéla Bartókand programmed many of Bartók's works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances.[21][22]
Women joined the orchestra for the first time during World War II. Eighteen women joined in 1942, and 24 more women joined in 1944. The PSO had more female performers than any other major American symphony during the war.[21]
Victor De Sabatacame to Pittsburgh in 1948, in part because of the urgings of his colleagueVladimir Bakaleinikoff, whom he had conducted inCincinnatiin 1927. Ticket sales increased with de Sabata at the helm. He was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted at theSyria Mosqueduring one of Pittsburgh's worst snowstorms.[23]He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1949, 1950, and 1951.[24]The orchestra established a Guest Conductor Chair in his name in 2010.
William Steinberg became the orchestra's music director in 1952.  During the early part of the 1950s, the Symphony played a number of ""industry concerts"", conducted by Steinberg and sponsored by area industries, specifically the United Steelworkers of America. The sponsorship offset costs for industry workers, and the Symphony performed in more convenient locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.[25][26]The Symphony continued to bring music to smaller communities in partnership with Manufacturers Heat and Light Company and Columbia Gas during the Steinberg era.[27]
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performed for audiences in Warsaw, Madrid, Berlin, Zagreb, Reykjavik, and 15 other locations throughout Europe and the Middle East during the State Department tour.[28]
Many of the orchestra's earlier recordings were made in theSyrian Mosquewith labels such asCapitol RecordsandColumbia Records.[29]The Pittsburgh Symphony performed at the Syria Mosque from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992.
Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony made several recordings for the Command label starting in 1962.  These recordings were made at theSoldiers and Sailors Memorial Hallin Pittsburgh.  The technical superiority of the Command recordings was aided by the company's use of 35mm film as the recording medium.[30]
Steinberg conducted his final Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts as music director in 1976, after which he returned for guest-conducting appearances as music director emeritus.[31][32]
André Previnsucceeded Steinberg as music director in 1976.  Previn had a collegial working style with symphony musicians and even formed a chamber music trio with Herbert Greenberg, associate concertmaster, and principal cellist Anne Martindale Williams around 1979.[33]In 1981, Previn renewed his contract with the symphony orchestra.[34]
During this time,Victoria Bondserved as an affiliate conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1978 to 1980. Bond was the first woman to earn a doctoral degree in orchestral conducting from theJuilliard Schooland is a prolific composer.  While at the Pittsburgh Symphony, she also served as the music director of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony and the New Amsterdam Symphony in New York City.[35]
Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Previn made their national debut on PBS with eight specials,Previn and the Pittsburgh. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored theEmmy-nominated[36]program, which ran for three years.[37]Guests on the program includedJohn Williams,Ella Fitzgerald, andOscar Peterson.
Previn left the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1984, but is credited with ""renewing the stature of the orchestra, expanding its position in the community, and giving the city a positive image internationally…""[38]
Lorin Maazelbecame music consultant to the orchestra in 1984.  In 1985, the orchestra elevated Maazel's title to music adviser and principal guest conductor.  In 1988, Maazel became music director of the orchestra.[39]Maazel announced in 1995 his intention to stand down music director of the orchestra in 1996, to focus on composition.[40][41]In addition to developing his compositional work, Maazel went on to direct and conduct the New York Philharmonic, along with several orchestras abroad. After his death in July 2014,[42]the Pittsburgh Symphony performed memorial pieces for Maazel as well as created a multimedia exhibit featuring Symphony archival materials related to the late director.[43]
Marvin Hamlischserved as principal pops conductor beginning in 1995 until his death in 2012.
A capital campaign was launched in 1993 to increase the Pittsburgh Symphony's endowment by $70 million.
On April 10, 1995, the orchestra announced the appointment ofMariss Jansonsto succeed Maazel in 1996 as its eighth music director.[44]Latvian–born Jansons was well received by critics and audiences in Pittsburgh, who applauded the ""warmth and humanity"" that he brought to the ensemble.  In addition to directing the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Jansons also served as an influential music director for theOslo PhilharmonicOrchestra inNorwayuntil 2002.[45]With Jansons, the Pittsburgh Symphony toured all over the world, introducing it to new audiences, and recorded extensively. During this time, the Symphony was ""innovative in drawing new elements of the Pittsburgh region’s population to concerts inHeinz Halland elsewhere."" Jansons conducted his last year as music director of the Symphony during the 2003–2004 season, after which he began acting as director of theBavarian Radio Symphony Orchestrain Munich.[46]
The Pittsburgh Symphony underGilbert Levinewas joined by the London Philharmonic Choir, Kraków Philharmonic Choir, Ankara Polyphonic Choir, and members of the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh in a program that included the world premiere of ""Abraham,"" a sacred motet by John Harbison, and Mahler Symphony No. 2 ""Resurrection.[47][48]The event, which was attended by the Pontiff, Rav Elio Toaff, Imam Abdulawahab Hussein Gomaa, and 7,000 invited guests, was telecast on RAI, on PBS, and throughout the world, and released on DVD by WQED Multimedia, Pittsburgh. Subsequent to this concert, at Levine's impetus, the Pittsburgh Symphony founded a series of concerts entitled ""Music for the Spirit.""[49]He led the first two of these performances of the Haydn ""Creation and Mahler Symphony No. 3 in Pittsburgh in 2006.[50]
With the 2005–2006 season, the PSO introduced a different model for artistic leadership. During this time, a new collective bargaining agreement was in effect, which gave the musicians increased authority over matters of running the orchestra, such as the hiring of musicians and choice of repertoire. Starting in 2005,Sir Andrew Davisserved as the PSO artistic advisor, withYan Pascal Tortelieras principal guest conductor andMarek Janowskiholding the ""endowed guest conductor chair.""
Sir Andrew Davis, while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles, paid special attention to the music of British and American composers. Davis had been an organ scholar before becoming a conductor. Under his direction, the Symphony performed many symphonic, operatic, and choral works ranging from baroque to contemporary.[51]Davis, aKnight Bachelorof Great Britain and music director of theLyric Opera of Chicago, had previously led the Pittsburgh Symphony several times as a guest conductor between 1977 and 1990.[52]
Davis was originally scheduled to step down after the 2007–2008 season, but in October 2007, Davis and the Pittsburgh Symphony mutually agreed to terminate his contract early and for him not to conduct his scheduled concerts in the 2007–2008 season because of increased demands on Davis' schedule.[53]The contracts of Tortelier and Janowski also expired in 2008.[54]Janowski now holds the Otto Klemperer Guest Conductor Chair with the PSO.
In May 2006,Manfred Honeckfirst guest-conducted the PSO.  He returned for another guest appearance in November 2006.  In January 2007, the PSO announced the appointment ofManfred Honeckas its ninth music director, effective with the 2008–2009 season, in a reversion of conductor leadership format to the traditional music director hierarchy.[55][56]His initial contract was for three years.  In September 2009, the PSO announced the extension of Honeck's contract to the 2015–2016 season.[57]In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2019–2020 season.[58]In June 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of American conductorLeonard Slatkinas the orchestra's principal guest conductor for the 2008–2009 season.[59][60]
In November 2006, the PSO announced a pledge of $29.5 million from the Richard P. Simmons family as the start of a capital challenge for the orchestra to address long-standing financial concerns.[61]In December 2006, the PSO announced the launch of an $80 million capital fund-raising drive after the initial $29.5 million boost from the Simmons family.[62]In March 2009, the PSO announced the discontinuation of its chamber orchestra series after the 2008–2009 season, along with staff reductions of 9 positions.[63]
In September 2009, the Pittsburgh Symphony and Honeck agreed to extend his contract through the 2015–2016 season.  In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2019–2020 season.[64]In September 2018, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2021–2022 season.[65]In September 2021, the PSO announced the newest extension of Honeck's contract as music director through the 2027–2028 season.[66]
Launched in 1977, ""Previn and the Pittsburgh"" was a series of specials produced by WQED-TV. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the programs, which ran for three years and became the highest rated classical music series on PBS. The program showcased the diversity of Music Director Andre Previn's musical interests, talents and friends. The first program explored Mozart, with Previn and the Pittsburgh Symphony'sPatricia Prattis Jenningsplaying four-handed piano sonatas. Others featured guest artists John Williams, conducting his music from ""Star Wars"" and ""E.T.,"" Ella Fitzgerald, Yo-Yo Ma, Pittsburgh Symphony principal cello Nathaniel Rosen (the first American cellist to win the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky International Competition), composer Stephen Sondheim and violinist Itzhak Perlman. Composer Miklos Rosza appeared as a guest to hear the Pittsburgh Symphony play his Oscar-winning score for the movie ""Ben-Hur."" Previn displayed his considerable talent as a jazz pianist in a duet with his friend Oscar Peterson, the man Duke Ellington dubbed ""the maharajah of the keyboard."" When cameras came into Heinz Hall to film the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra rehearsing in their shirtsleeves, audiences saw a relaxed maestro in bellbottoms who obviously liked and respected the musicians. The first show aired on February 27, 1977, and within two days the Pittsburgh Symphony sold more than 2,500 additional seats.[67]
Launched in 1982, the Pittsburgh Symphony Radio program is hosted by Jim Cunningham of WQED-FM. It is a complete two-hour concert with Music Director Manfred Honeck and guest artists heard on over 100 PRI and NPR stations across the country. The Pittsburgh Symphony was first broadcast in 1936 when NBC Blue Network began a series of 26 half-hour radio broadcasts over the NBC Blue Network of more than 90 stations. The broadcasts were sponsored by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.[68][69]
A $10-million reconstruction of the theater took place between 1967 and 1971. Although much of the structure and décor remained the same, a new five-story wing was added to the back of the building. This wing expanded the stage and rehearsal space along with the music library and dressing rooms.[70][71]
Several concerts took place before the remodel and reopening of the Hall in 1971, including a performance of works by Berlioz, Beethoven and Brahms by the Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin Trio for the 1969 pension fund concert. Questionnaires filled out by symphony followers were collected after the concert and reflected an overwhelming support of the new venue.[72]
Heinz Hall was dedicated in September 1971. The inaugural concerts took place on September 10 and 11 with William Steinberg conducting Beethoven's ""Consecration of the House"" overture and Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (""Resurrection"") with a combined chorus of Pennsylvania State University choirs. The New York Times published an outstanding review of the performances, citing the improvement of the acoustics over previous Symphony venues saying, ""Pittsburghers at last have the opportunity to hear (the orchestra) as it ought to sound.""[73]
The Garden Plaza and a four-story addition to the Hall were completed in 1982 by the firm of MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni. The plaza included a waterfall and sculpture by London-based artist Angela Connor. The addition to the Hall included two bar/lounge spaces as well as a dining and meeting room. In addition, some public areas were refurbished into reception facilities in 1988.[71]
A $6.5-million renovation began in 1995 with funding provided by the Howard Heinz Endowment and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Strategy 21 program funds. The renovation improved the acoustical, technical and aesthetic qualities of the Hall and was carried out by Architect Albert Filoni, of MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni, along with acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard.  The Hall reopened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Governor Tom Ridge and Teresa Heinz.[71]"

This organization reportedly oversees more than one million square feet of real estate, including commercial and residential buildings, making it one of the largest landowners downtown.[4][5]
In recent years, it has had a contentious relationship with the city of Pittsburgh concerning the tax status for many of its properties, resulting in a case being heard by the state Supreme Court in 2011.[6]
As of February 2023, the PCT's president and CEO isKendra Whitlock Ingram. According to its 2022 ""Report to the Community"", PCT'snet assetswere valued at $219 million.[1]
The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust was founded in 1984 byH. J. Heinz IIwith the principal aim of restoring downtown Pittsburgh as a vibrant cultural destination.[7]Heinz and others, includingWilliam Reaand his son,U.S. SenatorJohn Heinz, began with Pittsburgh's first renovated formermovie palace,Heinz Hall, (which was built as the former Loew's Penn Theater).
The PCT's first major project was the restoration of the formerStanley Theater. The Stanley Theater was originally designed by the firm ofHoffman & Henonand opened on February 27, 1928. Under the PCT's management, this theater underwent a $43 million restoration[8]and reopened in 1987 as the 2,800-seatBenedum Centerfor the Performing Arts. That year, the PCT and its partners presented an annual Broadway series in the Cultural District.

Carnegie Museums,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh,"
Carnegie Museums of Pittsburghis anonprofit organizationthat operates four museums inPittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States. The organization is headquartered in theCarnegie Institute and Librarycomplex in theOaklandneighborhood of Pittsburgh. The Carnegie Institute complex, which includes the original museum, recital hall, and library, was added to theNational Register of Historic Placeson March 30, 1979.
Two of the Carnegie museums, theCarnegie Museum of Natural Historyand theCarnegie Museum of Art, are both located in the Carnegie Institute and Library complex in Oakland, a landmark building listed on theNational Register of Historic Places(ref #79002158, added 1979). It also houses the Carnegie Music Hall and the main branch of theCarnegie Library of Pittsburgh.[3]
Andrew Carnegiedonated the library and the buildings. With the goal of inspiring people to do good for themselves and their communities, the terms for donations required communities to support them in exchange for the building and initial investment by Carnegie. The words ""free to the people"" inscribed above the entrance of theCarnegie Library of Pittsburghillustrate his vision.[4]The other two museums,The Andy Warhol Museumand theKamin Science Center, are located in separate facilities on Pittsburgh'sNorth Shore.[5]
Opened on May 15, 1994, theAndy Warhol Museumis the first museum to exclusively focus on an American postwar artist.[6]The building which houses the Andy Warhol Museum was originally built in 1911 for industrial purposes, but was redesigned for the museum by architectRichard Gluckman. The museum currently has seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground education studio and conservation lab.[7]
Warhol's primary artistic technique was silkscreen pop art, which he gained notoriety for in the early 1960s. The serial images derived from the culture's consumerism and conception of beauty are reified in a form of art which represent the identity of constituents in postwar American society.[8]Images used by Warhol, which have made him famous for his contributions topop art, include celebrities and consumables such asMarilyn MonroeandThe Campbell's soup can.
The museum's collection includes over 4,000 Warhol art works in allmedia—paintings,drawings,prints,photographs,sculptures, andinstallation; the entire Andy Warhol Video Collection, 228 four-minuteScreen Tests, and 45 other films by Warhol; and extensive archives, including Warhol'sTime Capsules. While dedicated to Andy Warhol, the museum also hosts many exhibits by contemporary artists.[9]
WhenAndrew Carnegieenvisioned a museum collection consisting of the ""Old Masters of tomorrow,"" the Carnegie Museum of Art arguably became the first museum ofmodern artin the United States. The museum was founded as the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute in 1895. The name was changed to its current name in[11]1986.
Today the museum continues showcasingcontemporary artby staging theCarnegie Internationalexhibition every three to five years. Numerous works from the International exhibitions have been acquired for the museums' permanent collection includingWinslow Homer'sThe Wreck(1896) andJames A. McNeill Whistler'sArrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate(1884).[12][13]
The Hall of Sculpture, constructed in whitemarble, replicates the interior of theParthenon.[14]The Hall of Architecture contains the largest collection ofplastercasts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world. Opened in 1974, the Sarah Scaife Galleries Annex was designed byEdward Larrabee Barnesand Associates. The Sarah Scaife Foundation gift nearly doubled the exhibition square footage. The modernist addition was designed to not compete with the existing building. Trustee James L. Winokur says of architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, ""He kept the old building out front. He was not terribly concerned about getting credit, just concerned about doing the job right, and he did do it right.""[10]
TheHeinz Architectural Center, opened as part of the museum in 1993, is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings, prints and models.[11]Most of these are from the 19th and 20th centuries.
In 2001 the museum acquired the archive ofAfrican-AmericanphotographerCharles ""Teenie"" Harris, consisting of approximately 80,000 photographic negatives spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s. Many of these images have been cataloged and digitized.
The museum's permanent collection includes European and American decorative arts from the late seventeenth century to the present, works on paper, paintings, prints (most notably Japanese prints), sculptures and installations.[11]
Opened alongside the Carnegie Museum of Art in 1895, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is currently home to over twenty million objects and artifacts. Carnegie oversaw the collecting from 1895 to 1907 and it reflected his ideas of evolutionary development.[4][15]
Most notably, it houses a collection of 230dinosaurfossils—including the most completeTyrannosaurus rexknown to date—as well as exhibits such asHillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians, and Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt. The museum'sPowdermill Nature Reservewas established in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations, and now forms the core of the museum's Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystems. Research teams that included Carnegie scientists have made discoveries such asPuijila darwiniandHadrocodium wui.[16][17]
Opened in 1991, but with a history that dates to October 24, 1939, the Kamin Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh.[9]The Kamin Science Center houses the Buhl Planetarium & Observatory, the Rangos Giant Cinema Theater, and a number of temporary and permanent exhibits, includingHighmark SportsWorks, theMiniature Railroad & Village, andthe Robot Hall of Fame.[9]
On February 21, 1990, Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz introduced Senate Bill S. 2151, which allowed theUSSRequin, aWorld War IIsubmarine, to be transferred as an exhibit for the science center. The purpose of the exhibit is for visitors to learn how people lived and worked on the boat.
The Buhl Planetarium and larger Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh merged in 1987, leading to an October 1989 groundbreaking on the newly-named Carnegie Science Center building. A large donation by the Kamin family led to the science center's renaming in 2024.[18]"

Named afterU.S. SenatorH. John Heinz III(1938–1991) from Pennsylvania, it is located in theStrip DistrictofPittsburgh.
The Heinz History Center is a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2)[2]educational institution ""that engages and inspires a diverse audience with links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with aWestern Pennsylvaniaconnection.""[3]
In 2024, the Heinz History Center was named the best history museum in America by readers of USA Today as part of their annual Readers' Choice poll.[4]
This museum's history began in 1879, with the formation of a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. In 1884, leaders changed the organization's name to theHistorical Society of Western Pennsylvania(HSWP); it has been operating continuously since then and is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization.[3]
HSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial ofsteamboatnavigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955, it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. During its early years, HSWP leaders held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, were granted space for the organization's archives at the newCarnegie Library of Pittsburghin theOaklandneighborhood.[3]
By 1914, HSWP had its own building on Bigelow Boulevard. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh'sStrip District.[3]The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by hosting an inaugural gala there on April 26, 1996, for 900 guests.[citation needed]In 2004, the Smithsonian wing was completed, adding a gallery for changing exhibitions from theSmithsonian Institution, a Special Collections Gallery, an Education Center, and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum.[5]
The History Center is named forH. John Heinz III, the late U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash.[2]
The century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted by the Pittsburgh office of the architecture firm ofBohlin Cywinski Jackson, who did the design and oversaw construction. The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is an exhibit in its own right.[6]
The History Center features the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Detre Library & Archives, and six floors of permanent and changing exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania.[7]

The Frick Pittsburgh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frick_Art_%26_Historical_Center,"
The Frick Pittsburghis a cluster of museums andhistorical buildingslocated inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, and formed around the Frick family's nineteenth-century residence known as ""Clayton"". It focuses on the interpretation of the life and times ofHenry Clay Frick(1849–1919), industrialist and art collector.
The complex, located on 5.5 acres (22,000 m2)[1]of lawn and gardens in the city'sPoint Breezeneighborhood, includes Clayton, the restored Frick mansion; The Frick Art Museum; The Car and Carriage Museum; the Greenhouse; the Frickchildren's playhouse; and The Café. The site welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year. Admission is free.
Helen Clay Frick(1888–1984) was the driving force to preserve the Frick estate and allow it to open to the public after her death.
Today's museum began as an eleven-room, Italianate-style house purchased by the Fricks shortly after their marriage in 1881.  The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown.  After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed ""Clayton"".  Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architectFrederick J. Osterling.  The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architectsAlden & Harlow. The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905.  The Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, where they eventually established theFrick Collection, but in 1981 daughter Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton, where she had previously spent part of each year, and remained there permanently until her death in 1984. Clayton opened to the public in 1990, and in 1997 the 1950s carriage house was enlarged to create the Car and Carriage Museum.[citation needed]
In May 2013 the center announced a $15 million renovation to break ground on June 6, 2013.[1][2]The renovation was completed in 2015; the Car and Carriage Museum was expanded to twice its original size, and a community center and education center were built.[3]

Picklesburgh,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picklesburgh,"Picklesburghis an annualpickle-themed festival inPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It has taken place inDowntown Pittsburghevery summer since 2015 (excluding 2020),[1]originally on theThree Sistersbridges and along theAllegheny Riverfront, before relocating to theBoulevard of the AlliesandPPG Placefor its 2023 installment.[2][3]
The festival showcases ""all thingspickled,"" including pickle-flavoredbeerandcocktails, pickleice cream, and other pickled foods such asdilly beansandkimchi.[2][4][5]It also features live music, children's activities, and an annualpickle juicedrinking competition, the winner of which is crowned the ""Mayor of Picklesburgh"".[3]The festival's centerpiece is a 35-foot-long (11 m)Heinzpickleballoon.[6]
Picklesburgh was voted the ""best specialtyfood festivalin America"" inUSA Todayreaders' polls in 2021, 2022, and 2023.[7]
The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18, 2015, on theRachel Carson BridgeinDowntown Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania.[2]Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, a non-profit organization, and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-basedHeinz(nowKraft Heinz), the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh's rich history ofpickling.[8][9]Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles ""speak to the ethnic, cultural history of Pittsburgh, as amelting potforEastern Europeanethnic communities"",[10]although numerous countries ofWestern culturewith significant diasporas in the United States, likeGermanyandPoland, also employ pickling in their national cuisines. According to Waldrup, the festival was also inspired by the growingfarm-to-tablemovement and the trend ofurban homesteading.[8]
At Picklesburgh 2016, the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge, Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years.[11]The 2017 festival was held at the nearbyRoberto Clemente Bridge, where it also took place in 2018 and 2019, gradually taking up more abutting street space each year.[12][13]Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015, a three-day schedule was established in 2018, which was further expanded to four days in 2024.[14][15]Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, but it returned in August 2021 with additional safety precautions on theAndy Warhol Bridge.[16]
In 2022, the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge, with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass.[17]Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees, leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to preventovercrowding.[18]Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked, ""At times, especially during our peak hours, it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance.""[19]
In response, for its 2023 installment, the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of theBoulevard of the AlliesbetweenStanwix Streetand Smithfield Street, and alongMarket StreetintoPPG Place.[6]Even with its larger location, Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors.[20]Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds, 16 attendees were hospitalized due toheat exhaustionand other ailments.[21]
Since its founding in 2015, every Picklesburgh festival has featured apickle juicedrinking competition as its headline event.[22]In the competition, contestants race to drink aquart-sizedjarof pickle juice without regurgitating, spilling, or leaving any juice in the jar.[9][22]The winner is dubbed the ""Mayor of Picklesburgh"" and receives a belt and a $500 cash prize, as of 2023.[9][23]
The 2023 champion and reigning ""Mayor of Picklesburgh"" is Pittsburgh native Dan Koba, who drank the jar of pickle juice in 7 seconds.[22]The all-time record was set at Picklesburgh 2022, whenWisconsin-basedTikTokcontent creator Jalen Franko won the competition by drinking the quart of juice in 4.5 seconds.[24]"
