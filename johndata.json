In silent-era Hollywood, stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is brought to a hospital after an on-set accident leaves him paralysed. There, he befriends a young girl called Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) and starts telling her a fantastical tale of epic heroes trying to take revenge on an evil ruler - whilst secretly planning his own suicide. He captivates her with this whimsical story that removes her far from the hospital doldrums into the exotic landscapes of her imagination. \u201cTarsem Singh\u2019s \u2018The Fall\u2019 is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms.

Tarsem, for two decades a leading director of music videos and TV commercials, spent millions of his own money to finance \u2018The Fall,\u2019 filmed it for four years in 28 countries and has made a movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists.

Heralded as the most important win for labor since the 1930s, this timely documentary captures the Amazon Labor Union\u2019s historic grassroots campaign to unionize thousands of their co-workers from day one of organizing. Led by the charismatic but underestimated Chris Smalls, the diverse band of workers start the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) and embark on a journey against one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. The odds are stacked against them, as the group finds itself up against a tech industry giant with unlimited resources, without major support from national unions or politicians, and while navigating internal divisions within their own ranks. Filmmakers Brett Story and Stephen Maing document the struggle from day one, offering a gripping human drama about the fight for power and dignity in today's globalized economic landscape.

Join us for Faces of Resilience, a transformative two-day workshop at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, where you\u2019ll create powerful masks to express your emotions, celebrate your loved ones, and honor your triumphs. These workshops are offered in partnership with Project Safe Storage and will be facilitated by Tia Baker and Dr. Lois Dabney-Smith. Workshops will be offered in August, September and October. Each workshop is a Saturday and Sunday and will be offered in August (3&4), September (14&15), and October (26&27) from 9am-5pm. The masks will be displayed during Community Day on December 14th, in conjunction with a panel discussion with Community Leaders in the violence prevention space. Why Two Days? ? In-Depth Healing: Healing takes time. Over two days, you\u2019ll have the space to deeply explore and process your emotions, ensuring a more profound and lasting impact. ? Comprehensive Guidance: With extended sessions, our experienced art therapists can provide more thorough guidance, helping you unlock deeper levels of creativity and self-expression. ? Community Building: Two days allow for stronger connections to form within the group, creating a supportive community that understands and shares your journey. ? Reflect & Refine: The second day offers the opportunity to refine and complete your mask, process the weekend\u2019s experiences, and close out with a special ceremony. What Will You Gain? ? Emotional Healing: Through guided mask-making, you\u2019ll find a unique, non-verbal way to process and release deep-seated emotions, paving the way for profound healing. ? Celebrate Loved Ones: Use your art to honor the memories and legacies of those you cherish, creating a beautiful tribute to their impact on your life. ? Empowerment & Resilience: Transform your pain into powerful expressions of resilience, discovering new strengths and pathways to self-discovery and hope. How to Prepare? The masks you create will be actual molds of your face, offering a unique and personal touch to your artistic expression. We recommend that women attend without makeup and all participants wear comfortable clothes that you don\u2019t mind getting paint on to ensure the best experience. Guided Art Sessions: Experienced art therapists will lead you through each step, helping you unlock your creativity and emotions. Supportive Community: Connect with fellow survivors in a safe, understanding environment, sharing, and reflecting on your journey together. Panel Discussion: At the end of the workshop series, some participants will have the opportunity to join community leaders in a panel discussion at the August Wilson Center to discuss the impact of the project and share their experiences. Meals Provided: Enjoy continental breakfast and lunch for both days, ensuring you\u2019re nourished and focused on your healing journey. Special Ceremony: Conclude the workshop with a special ceremony to honor your journey, celebrate your resilience, and reflect on the weekend\u2019s experiences. By the end of this weekend, you\u2019ll leave with: A tangible, artistic expression of your journey and resilience. Newfound connections and support from a community of fellow survivors. The empowerment that comes from reclaiming your narrative and celebrating your loved ones. An opportunity to voice your story and impact the community through a panel discussion.

Hear firsthand accounts from veterans and military families who will share their personal journeys of how military life has shaped their identities and their lives. This program is not just about listening \u2013 it\u2019s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences. The \u201cHomefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War\u201d program is held in conjunction with the History Center\u2019s new exhibition, A Woman\u2019s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime. Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.

Visit at your convenience between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Cost: Free PHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail. Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail\u2019s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown\u2014 at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219\u2014 opened in 2005. To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint. The use of cameras is NOT permitted. For further information\u2013\u2013or to double-check that the Jail Museum will be open on a particular Monday, contact Mary Lu Denny: at marylu@phlf.org or call 412-471-5808, ext. 527.

From Bavarian beer halls to the high peaks of the Alps, take a \"Walk on the Wild Side,\" AKA our very own Novemberfest inspired by Strauss's sublime An Alpine Symphony. First, join us for the pre-show party around Heinz Hall. Enjoy a glass of Bavarian beer or a specialty cocktail from the Biergarten, explore music-themed activities, take photos, and mingle with fellow guests before heading into this short (but epic) performance. An Alpine Symphony is a single-movement piece with 22 phases that runs just around 50 minutes. Over 100 musicians are required to bring Strauss's transcendental tone poem to life: a journey through the fierce elements, apparitions, and mysteries of nature. Listen for stormy winds, echoes of thunder in the distance, birdcalls, and a triumphant summit. It's awe-inspiring. You can't help but smile. You'll wish you brought your hiking shoes. Forget everything you\u2019ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music. Whether you\u2019re new to classical music or just want to explore the music in a new way, expect moments of fascination, guided from the stage. Relaxed atmosphere | Shorter concerts | On-stage host | Signature cocktails \u201cI invite all our subscribers to experience Disrupt.

            "description": "For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \u201cThe Rainbow Club,\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond\u2019s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol\u2019s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America\u2019s most loved cereal boxes including Reese\u2019s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol\u2019s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol\u2019s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.

            "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\u2019Amico Fried\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail\u2019s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown\u2014 at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219\u2014 opened in 2005.

Enjoy a glass of Bavarian beer or a specialty cocktail from the Biergarten, explore music-themed activities, take photos, and mingle with fellow guests before heading into this short (but epic) performance. An Alpine Symphony is a single-movement piece with 22 phases that runs just around 50 minutes. Over 100 musicians are required to bring Strauss's transcendental tone poem to life: a journey through the fierce elements, apparitions, and mysteries of nature. Listen for stormy winds, echoes of thunder in the distance, birdcalls, and a triumphant summit. It's awe-inspiring. You can't help but smile. You'll wish you brought your hiking shoes. Forget everything you\u2019ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music.

Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail\u2019s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown\u2014 at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219\u2014 opened in 2005.

            "description": "For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \u201cThe Rainbow Club,\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond\u2019s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

            "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\u2019Amico Fried\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

            "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\u2019Amico Fried\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol\u2019s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America\u2019s most loved cereal boxes including Reese\u2019s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol\u2019s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol\u2019s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.

            "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\u2019Amico Fried\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

            "description": "Home Things to Do Pittsburgh Sports Teams History of the Terrible Towel History of the Terrible Towel Discover the history of The Terrible Towel of the Pittsburgh Steelers which began with Myron Cope and lives on today. The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope , the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\" In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium , VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again. The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween , Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium ). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19. For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships. On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he\u2019s somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\" The Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history , fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022.

Whether you're visiting from out-of-town or haven't been to a game in a while, check out our Pittsburgh Steelers and Acrisure Stadium guide for every football fan. Getting to Acrisure Tailgating Eat & Drink Interactive Map Steelers Trivia Where do the Steelers play their home games? Acrisure Stadium is the celebrated football stadium, situated in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that proudly serves as the home of the Steelers. Credit | Pittsburgh Steelers How to get to Acrisure Stadium Public Transportation Since parking on the North Shore near the stadium is reserved and pre-sold, it's often easier to park and ride to the stadium using other options. Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) offers light rail service on the T and city buses for fans coming from Downtown Pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. You can find more information on how to get to the stadium on the PRT website . Riverboat Shuttles The Gateway Clipper also offers gameday riverboat rides to the stadium and is my personal favorite way to get to the game. Park at Station Square, grab your tickets and enjoy your ride around the Point with raucous, fun-loving fans before getting dropped off right at the stadium. Find more information about riverboat shuttles here . Driving & Parking Information If you are planning to drive and park near the stadium, visit ALCO parking for a helpful interactive guide to parking on the North Shore. Where\u2019s the best place to tailgate before a Steelers game? The tailgating scene in Pittsburgh is as fun as the Steelers game itself!

Shorty's Pins & Pints , Southern Tier , Tom's Watch , Burgatory and Bar Louie are popular spots to grab a craft beer pre- or post-game that are walkable to Acrisure. Even if you don't have a ticket, these locales are some of the best places to watch the game outside of Acrisure Stadium, promising a lively atmosphere and passionate fans cheering on every play to go with your food and drink. Shorty's Pins x Pints is the ultimate North Shore stop What else to do near Acrisure Stadium? There's so much to do in the North Shore we did a whole blog about everything to explore pre- or post-game, from stadium tours and museum visits to kayaking, duckpin bowling and shopping for the latest Steelers merch. Browse the map below to see everything going on nearby in the North Shore. Just double check times and hours of operation which can sometimes change on Steelers Sundays. What is the Acrisure Stadium bag policy? Leave your backpacks and large tote bags at home because Acrisure Stadium has an \u201cAll Clear On Game Day\u201d safety policy requiring guests to carry their items in clear bags. Any non-clear bag exceeding 4.5\u201d by 6.5\u201d is not permitted. For all the security guidelines detailing what you can and cannot bring into the stadium, including food, drinks, strollers, and more, check out the security guidelines page here . Where to Eat inside the stadium? You can now find Pittsburgh favorite Caliente Pizza locations as well as Little Caesars pizza stops throughout the stadium for your pizza fix. Other fan favorites now on the menu in-stadium include Burgatory hamburgers and milkshakes, Primanti's signature french-fry topped sandwiches, Kennywood's Potato Patch fries and Papa Duke's gyros. We also blogged about our favorites to eat at Acrisure. If you want to gauge all your options, the Steelers Mobile App has an interactive map showing the concessions and where they are located, as well as mobile ordering options so you can skip the line and never miss a snap. Are there Family-Friendly Activities for Steelers fans? Yes! The Steelers Hall of Honor Museum , located near Gate B of Acrisure Stadium, is open to the public year-round Thursday through Monday from 11 a.m.-4 p.m. It's a perfect pre-game experience for fans of all ages. Walk through every decade of Steelers history with interactive displays loaded with memorabilia. Guests can even step into the announce booth and call their own plays as they relive the greatest moments in Steelers history. For passes, museum exhibits and all you need to know for your visit, explore our Insider's Guide to the Hall of Honor . Outside of the stadium, be sure to head to Art Rooney Avenue on game day for the Steelers Experience and a family fun zone. And, if you're arriving early for the game or extending your trip by a few days, you don't need to leave the North Shore neighborhoods for family fun . Steelers Hall of Honor Museum More Cool Things to Do Near Acrisure Stadium Show your Pittsburgh pride by taking a selfie with the Roberto Clemente Statue, which sits outside of PNC Park. Stand at the spot of the Immaculate Reception, the most well-known play in NFL history, where Steelers legend Franco Harris caught a ball just before it touched the grass and changed the fate of the franchise.

Tap into sports history at the Senator John Heinz History Center's Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum , the ultimate museum for Pittsburgh sports lovers. Credit | Senator John Heinz History Center Facebook Page Don't Forget to Brush Up On Your Pittsburgh Steelers Trivia What is The Terrible Towel? Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognizable symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Towels can be purchased in stadium or at sports stores around the North Shore. What is the song played during the fourth quarter? When the Steelers need a big stop in the fourth quarter, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Acrisure Stadium. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. What\u2019s the meaning behind the Steelers logo? While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo. Each of the hypocycloids represents one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore and steel scrape is illustrated with blue. Why do Steelers fans chant \u201cHere We Go Steelers?\u201d During games, you'll hear fans chanting \"Here We Go, Steelers!\" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. \u201cHere We Go,\u201d originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. When should I head to a game this season? Take a look at the Steelers\u2019 2024 schedule here!

What follows is two yinzers\u2019 quest to eat their way around PNC Park and recap their favorite finds and flavors. Looking for a comprehensive guide to everything in the park? Check out this blog . Dessert Pierogi and Chicken Biscuit locations Riverwalk Area (Outfield) Our journey begins at the Riverwalk, once a more closed off region of the park and expanded in 2022 into a vibrant collection of new concession areas, seating right along the outfield, selfie spots, kids areas and gigantic Pirates bobbleheads of all-time greats. This revitalization also led to the park infusing this area with authentic Pittsburgh cuisine, partnering with local restaurants to develop next-level ballpark food with Only In Pittsburgh inspiration. Chicken on the Hill (section 144/145) features a menu inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District , and Cannonball Burger (section 145/145) features Station in Bloomfield\u2019s creations, transforming this stretch into one of PNC Park\u2019s best food spots. Jared: The chicken biscuit is messy but so worth it. Grab some extra napkins for this bad boy. The biscuit is buttery and flaky, the house pickle adds the acidity this needs and the breaded chicken itself is perfectly fried with just a hint of heat. This is top tier ballpark eating. Courtney: The dessert pierogi from Cannonball Burger are unlike anything else in the park! These pillowy pockets have a great sweet cheese filling that keep you going back for bite-after-bite without being overly sweet. This is such a fun treat to snack on chillier days in the park when you're not feeling ice cream. Bonus Tip: Don\u2019t go back to your seats yet. Enjoy your meal at one of the seats right against the outfield railing for an amazing view of the game while you chow down. Circle the outfield to find all of the new food options for 2024 New Food Roundup (Throughout PNC Park) Looking to try everything new in the park this summer? Me too! Here's a quick recap on where to find everything new this season: Renegade Hot Dog (Section 133 in Pop's Plaza) Pitt Dog and Cheddar and Chive Brat (135 at Deli Dogs) Roasted corn on the cob, birria beef nachos and caramel churros (137 at LowKey Taco) Chicken Biscuit (144 at Coop de Ville) Dessert Pierogi (144 at Cannonball Burger) Jared: My expectations were sky-high after this went viral before the season, and it is absolutely worth the buzz. The pierogis make this visually stunning (it's absolutely a requirement to take photos of every angle before eating) but my favorite elements of this came from the combo of the briny pickles and savory shredded beef and onions. You get some crunch, some snap, some well-developed slow-cooked goodness and a big mouthful of potatoes in each bite - welcome to the pinnacle of ballpark dining. Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? Two Must-Stops: Deli Dogs and Nachoritas in left Deli Dogs and Nachoritas (Left Field) Making our way into left field, two of the newer food options immediately made us stop and load up before we got to our seats. Deli Dogs (section 135) features upscale takes on the classic ballpark hot dog, with high-quality dogs and buns served Chicago, chili and other styles. Nachoritas (section 137) again elevates the simple nachos and cheese we love and adding queso, crema and now even birria to elevate the experience. Jared: Who knew eating corn at the ballpark would be this good? The elote from Nachoritas might seriously be my favorite food in the ballpark now. The crisp snap of the corn combined with the cotija cheese with a nice kick from the crema, and that's the best bite anywhere. Courtney: Ok, this Pitt Dog from Deli Dogs is straight \ud83d\udd25. I'm loving the heat from the cap and the crunch from the coleslaw and fried onions. Perfection. Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Fathead's and Cinderlands are the spots to find local drafts Local Beer (Center Field and Left Field Rotunda) Watching pitchers warm up is always fun at PNC Park, but there was never anywhere to sit. Enter the Bullpen Tap Bar , which offers eight of local brewer Fat Head's signature beers on tap along with a rotating selection of other breweries such as North County, Cinderlands Beer Co and even Threadbare Cider. Seats are available on the railing overlooking the bullpen, making this a perfect way to pass a few later innings. Walk-Thru Bru locations throughout the park let you pick a can (Cinderlands and Iron City were available in every cooler I saw) but the true gem is right under the left field rotunda near Section 133, where Cinderlands is set up with drafts and cans you won't find anywhere else in the park. Courtney: I think it\u2019s awesome that the Pirates are doing their part to promote local breweries, and Fat Head\u2019s has plenty of awesome selections. My favorite is this Lime Feein\u2019 Good Mexican-Style lager. Jared: The Cinderlands Corner Bar is my hidden gem of the entire park. It's the perfect mix of IPAs and other lighter beers that pair perfect with ballgame weather, and there's almost never a line. Brain freeze here Something Sweet For those of us with a sweet tooth, the cookie sundae is the best dessert option in the park. You can find it at the Sweet Spot (section 106) or The Cookie & Creamery (section 119) in the infield concourse. Every ice cream/cookie combination goes great with each other, especially during a hot afternoon game, and comes served in a Pirates batting helmet. Healthy Options Error. This is not that type of article. Seriously though, there\u2019s some fresh, innovative salads at the Market behind home plate, but the only vegetables we touched were the celery than came with the wings. Primanti's and Manny's locations Don't Forget the Classics We were stuffed after our culinary tour, but it\u2019s still worth mentioning a few other spots for great grub in the park. Grab some Only In Pittsburgh Primanti Bros. sandwiches, piled high with coleslaw and french fries, located behind section 108. My personal PNC Park tradition is to always make sure I stop by Manny\u2019s (also sporting a newly-designed space) in left field, where you can often find Pirates great Manny Sanguill\u00e9n seated near the end of the line, who is happy to chat with fans and relive some of his greatest moments.

Speaking of treats...eating at PNC Park is a culinary adventure ! It's part of the whole ballgame experience . Here are some suggestions that go beyond peanuts and cracker jacks, AND check out some of our favorite ballgame traditions here . NEW FOR 2024 Hot Dogs & Wursts Galore \ud83c\udf2d PNC Park has gone all in on the ballpark staple with three new upscale versions of this easy-to-eat snack all available at different locations. The Renegade Hot Dog (Section 133: order it at the kiosks in Pop's Plaza with the Cannonball Burger and crab fries ) is going to be an instant Yinzer classic: this footlong is piled with pot roast, mini pierogi, pickles and onions for a fantastic taste of Pittsburgh's food passion contained in a single bite. Other new additions here including the Pitt Dog (Section 135) that's topped with capicola, vinegar slaw and provolone cheese from the popular Deli Dogs stand, and an amazing looking cheddar and chive brat with classic toppings of peppers, onions and mustard. Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? More From Local Restaurants \ud83c\udf3d It's corn! LowKey Taco (Section 138) continues to expand their menu offerings this year at their Nachorita stand, adding roasted corn on the cob (such a great addition to snack on as you watch the game), birria beef nachos and even some sweet caramel churros to make this stand a must-stop in 2024. Keep walking around the outfield to Section 144 and find Coop de Ville's all-new chicken biscuit ! This is already my go-to stop in the stadium, but adding on a flaky biscuit and house pickles to their already incredible chicken is going to be even better. Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Dessert Pierogi? Dessert Pierogi! \ud83c\udf68 \ud83e\udd5f Yeah, you read that right. Cannonball Burger (Section 146) is adding a sweet version of this Pittsburgh staple, starting with sweet cheese stuffed dumplings and smothering them in chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. If it's a hit, expect sweet pierogi to start popping up all over the city! PNC PARK FAVORITES Manny's BBQ Left Field This newly remodeled barbecue stand is named after former Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen , who has been known to hang around and sign autographs for fans. Eagle-eyed snack connoisseurs will note the new addition of the topped Mrs. T's mini pierogis you can get with either BBQ pork or chicken On the menu : house smoked BBQ pork and chicken, mac n cheese, topped mini pierogis, slaw Chicken on the Hill & Cannonball Burger Right Field Two local Pittsburgh restaurants ( Coop De Ville and Station ) helped inspire the menus at these spots, and both are located right near seats and tables along the outfield wall to sit and enjoy your meal. On the menu : Nashville hot chicken sandwich, double ranch burgers, big mozz cheese sticks, plant burgers Pop's Plaza Section 132 Be sure to take advantage of all the new improvements in this section of the ballpark. The tech here allows you to get everything delicious here in one place, with kiosks to order from one central location and get your crab fries, ballpark burgers and more. On the menu: Chickie's & Pete's Crabfries (get extra cheese, dipping these things gets addictive), burgers View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chickie's & Pete's (@chickiesandpetes) Primanti Bros. Section 108 You can't go wrong with a Primanti 's sandwich piled high with fresh deli meats and cheeses and topped off with French fries and cole slaw. A true Pittsburgh classic. Just around the corner from this booth is Wings & Things by Caliente, another regional favorite selling buckets of fresh wings and boneless wings. First-timers read this : The Pitts-Burger is the go-to order here, which will be a ground beef patty, coleslaw and fries all piled on freshly-baked white bread. Fat Head's Bullpen Bar Center Field It's easy to find good beer throughout the park (North Country's Fireman's Red is my go-to during game day), but the Bullpen Bar specifically features the flavors brewed right here in the city including rotating favorites from Threadbare, Cinderlands, Aslin and other top-notch pours. The Market Section 118 (Home Plate) Try something on the healthier side at this grab-and-go space. The quinoa salad is a filling and delicious alternative to hot dogs and loaded with peppers, tomatoes and a balsamic dressing. On the menu: Grab-n-go salads, vegan bruschetta wrap Deli Dogs & Nachoritas Sections 135 and 137 For me, hot dogs are the quintessential ballpark food. Find the best in the park as you head to the bottom of the rotunda in left field and head towards center field. On the menu : chili, classic and Chicago-style dogs inspired by local Smallman Street Deli Sweet Spot Behind Section 106 Treat yourself to a helmet cookie sundae, served just as it says with a fresh baked cookie on top of ice cream in a souvenir helmet sundae bowl. No Pittsburgh home is complete without a few of these on hand. Caliente Pizza Sections 113-114, 123, 313, 304 Already a fan favorite at other Pittsburgh stadiums, Caliente Pizza & Draft House is serving up giant slices of Sicilian, pepperoni and cheese pizza to fans at PNC Park. Find them throughout the ballpark at concessions sections in sections 113-114, 123, 313 and 304. Plus, they also now run the Wings & Things stand next to Primantis for your fix of giant buckets of mouthwatering wings. Cinderlands Corner Bar Bottom of the left field rotunda Easily the best kept secret in the park right now, but one I'm happy to share. Head to the bottom of the left field rotunda, keep walking around to the back of the structure and grab the best beer in the park direct from Cinderlands. Cans Available: Raise It, Squish, Lil Cinder Lime, Full Squish If these aren't enough for you, check out these unique offerings at PNC Park , or head to a ball game soon for great baseball and a smorgasbord of food choices!

But what if I told you one of the best nights out in the city happens in a stadium on the south side of the city, complete with scenic views, exciting games and a friendly, high-energy atmosphere? Enter the Pittsburgh Riverhounds , the city's professional soccer team. Before you exit the blog and try to tell me soccer is boring, hear me out. The Hounds (as they're affectionately known) play playoff caliber soccer on the pitch, but the entire game experience from tailgating to after-the-game activities are geared to keep adults and kids happy. Follow along with my Insider's Guide to the Hounds for my tips on what's new for the 2024 season, the best places to sit, the food to grab and some info you'll only be able to find in this blog. I've been following the Riverhounds for years, and can confidently say that your ticket to the game is one of the best values in sports anywhere in the country. What's New for 2024 Something that keeps me coming back to the Hounds every year is that there's always something new and exciting happening for games so that no two evenings are alike. Here's just a few highlights of the promotions happening in 2024 : Pittsburgh Celebrity Appearances - May 18 (Michael Winslow from Space Balls ), July 6 (Hacksaw Jim Duggan from pro wrestling) and Oct. 12 (Judith O'Dea from Night of the Living Dead ). Keep an eye on social for more details as these are announced. Giveaways nights March 16 (mini-banner and thundersticks), June 1 (Kenardo Forbes bobblehead), May 4 (Amo squish), July 13 (Hounds Mount Rushmore) and Oct. 12 (puzzle mosaic). Halftime Shows are coming to Highmark Stadium! See Loop Rawlins April 6, Zooperstars July 27, magician/ventriloquist Aug. 10, and Chainsaw Juggling (yes, you read that right) on Sept. 7 The return of even more pre-match $1 beer nights - April 27, July 20 and Sept. 28. Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Credit | Chris Cowger A New Look for 2024 I've collected a number of Hounds t-shirts and jerseys throughout the year, but the new kit for 2024 was an automatic must-buy. Pictured here are the all-new home kit, fittingly called the Three Rivers and emblazoned with an iconic gold bridge with a design I've not seen from any other sports team. The away kit, called Steel, is no less striking with a gold base design and grey accents. Fans can grab these exclusive new fits from apparel experts Charly online . Affordable Family Fun Between the concessions, tickets and merch, going to a sporting event lately can quickly become expensive. Thankfully, there's no $18 cotton candy at Highmark Stadium. The Riverhounds make every effort to keep the cost of tickets and concessions low, making this sport accessible for fans to see live. Single game tickets start at $20 and parking is cheap and plentiful at lots and garages on that side of the city. This year, fans can even pre-pay for parking passes in the main lot to take all the stress out of game day. Let's talk atmosphere. Hounds games are programmed with kids in mind, and the fan experience is equally accommodating. You'll be sitting next to other families, local soccer teams and fellow fans, so kids are always welcome here! While there's a lot of cheering, the vibe is positive and even the other team's fans are here to have a good time. There's plenty for kids to do at the stadium, too, even if they aren't as into the game. Head to the area behind the Supporters section to kick a soccer ball around with new friends and jump around in a bounce house to get out some energy. After the final whistle, stick around for the post-game autograph session when kids can meet their favorite players or just run around on the field. Photo Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds What to Eat and Drink If you've read my other sports blogs , you know my top concern for any sporting event is what I'm going to eat. Luckily, the Riverhounds understand what their fans want and provide a ton of tasty options that won't break the bank. New for 2024: Highmark Stadium is now the first in Pittsburgh to carry Crumbl Cookies! Check out the Tailgate Zone and Kid Zone for Oreo crumb cake, milk chocolate chip, confetti and snickerdoodle! Also new for this year is the addition of Stateside Vodka products including their refreshing Surfside seltzers. Even better, the fan fave pizza logs are now on the menu full-time. You'll also find conventional concession stand items at stands dotted around the stadium, but keep a special eye out for: Rotating food trucks before the game in their Tailgate Zone offering fresh flavors of the Burgh Burger and nacho specials that rotate throughout the season (March specials include the Irish whiskey bacon burger and corned beef nachos) Gluten-free vegan wraps, grilled chicken wraps and veggie wraps The Family Fun Zone concession stand that lets you grab popcorn, cotton candy and other kid staples quickly without missing a minute of the action. Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Credit | Chris Cowger Where to Sit I know people like to say this old clich\u00e9, but there's truly not a bad seat in the house at Highmark Stadium . The best viewing experience is sitting as close to the middle of the field and as high up as possible, giving you the best view of not only the game but also the city as trains buzz past and let out a friendly puff of steam midgame. If your love of the beautiful game can't be contained, you'll find your outlet in the Supporters Section . This high-energy end of the stadium is where the Steel Army resides, drumming, leading chants throughout the game and setting off smoke during the frenzy of a goal celebration. My kids now demand that we sit there for every game and yell and laugh along. Want to bring a group ? I've had a blast with bachelor parties and work events in their club suites and the party deck, but the top option here is the I.C. Light Corner Kick Suite. This shipping container-turned-luxury suite gives up to 40 guests seats right on the field just feet from the action, and the viewing deck on top of the Box is the most unique view in pro sports. Tickets The Hounds make it easy to get tickets online , at the box office or at 412-865-GOAL for single games, season tickets and other options. My only recommendation here is that if you plan on going to several games this year, grab their flexbook . You get 11 tickets for the price of 10 and can use them however you want per game, whether you end up going solo or bringing the whole fam. Photo Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Join the Steel Army We all cheer for the yellow soccer team / The yellow soccer team / The yellow soccer team. Steel Army chant Ready to become a true superfan of the Hounds? Consider joining the Steel Army , the independent supporters group for the team! This group not only brings the energy to the home games and tail gates, but helps organize trips and watch parties for the rest of the schedule. What I love about the Steel Army is how welcoming they are for new members. Feel free to walk right into their tailgate and say hello, and within five minutes you'll have a burger in hand and have met five new friends. Photo Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Things to Do Nearby The fun doesn't stop when the game is over. It's easy to make a trip to see the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium into an all-day trip. The stadium is located right at the edge of Station Square, a 1.2 mile stretch of great dining and inventive ways to explore the city. Take an ebike tour of the city with Adam Solar Rides or see the Square via horse drawn carriage at Mike's Carriage Service . Station Square is also home to the Mon Incline and the Gateway Clipper, two of the most iconic ways to take in the city via funicular and riverboat. Got some insider info to share?

Rugby with Battle Axes. Human Demolition Derby. There's nothing like armored combat Are you ever just mindlessly scrolling through your social media when something makes you stop and gasp in wonder? That was my experience when I saw a video from Pittsburgh Armored Combat with axes and bodies flying as crowds roared in approval. I had to know more, so I instantly reached out to Chris Sanner, who heads up the combat sport in Pittsburgh, and entered a kingdom I never expected. Shine up your armor, grab your sword and give your best war cry as we delve into this hard-hitting phenomenon. Before I describe it, I think it's best to simply watch a bit from the video below: Your Armored Combat Primer If you're wondering exactly what you just watched, that's okay, so was I at first! Pittsburgh Armored Combat is best described as Medieval MMA, where fighters don gleaming armor and blunted weapons to do real battle inside a cage or similar enclosed structure. This isn't WWE or the local ren fair, the armor is real and these combatants are full-contact fighting for glory as they attack, grapple, throw and go for takedowns. The fights you'll see in Pittsburgh can vary. One-on-one battles have weight classes, a time limit and scoring system, similar to rounds in other combat sports, as fighters rack up points for edge strikes with their weapon, disarming their opponent and taking them to the ground. Then, there's team fighting. Instead of points, these melees are last person standing affairs as our heroes take their opposition to the dirt by any means necessary. There's no weight classes in team fights, leading to inventive matchups as quicker fighters try to outwit their taller adversaries or team up for takedowns. Bodies are flying around the cage as dogpiles, individual duels and jumps make for a fracas accentuated with by loud clangs of metal on metal and a rapt audience responding to every elimination. The Armor, the History and the Resurgence Now that you understand the sport a bit more, it's fun to delve into the details, starting with the armor you're seeing in these photos and videos. You can't get this equipment off of Amazon. Instead, armor and helmets are custom made by expert armorsmiths in the Ukraine or Russia for each fighter. The full armor set weighs anywhere from 50-80 lbs, making every aerial and acrobatic move all the more impressive. Medieval tournament fighting is a 900-year-old sport and operates largely the same today as it did back then. Fighters aren't trying to hurt or maim their opponents, this is a display of skill and respect as well as combat prowess, which leads to a very healthy community that has caused armored combat to thrive as a sport. Affectionately described as rugby with battle axes by Sanner, armored combat started surging in popularity after the Knight Fight television show debuted on the the History Channel. Since then, the tournament scene has blown up with tournaments almost every weekend culminating in Carolina Carnage, their Super Bowl with 400 fighters looking to be crowned champions on a national stage. Celebrities have taken note too, with Arnold Schwarzenegger showing a special interest in the sport and actor Tom Hardy even donning the armor to fight. Bringing the Action to Pittsburgh Chris Sanner of Pittsburgh Armored Combat was always into combat sports, practicing martial arts, boxing and jiu jitsu, as well as interests in Dungeons & Dragons, history and video games. But in 2019, he was watching the aforementioned Knight Fight tv show when everything changed as he saw all of his personal interests come together. \"My first reaction was 'is this real,'\" said Sanner. \"It looked like human demolition derby.\" Unfortunately for Sanner, he could only find one active fighter in Pittsburgh at the time and was similarly slowed by the pandemic. But much like a brave tale of old, Sanner soldiered on and established himself as a well-known fighter while building a cadre of fellow fighters. Not only is it fun to don armor and swing an axe at people, but Sanner also emphasizes what makes this so appealing for fighters. \"This is something I do because it has a positive impact on the people I train with. Armored combat keeps people interested more than the gym, it helps with mental health, it helps with weight loss and it gives you martial arts training all in one sport.\" Trained and battle-hardened, Sanner and his knights are now bringing Pittsburgh Armored Combat to the people of Pittsburgh. Where to See Pittsburgh Armored Combat Sanner's group puts on live events throughout the city with fight cards brimming with group battles and individual duels to ever-growing crowds. Their next event is Sept. 2, 2023 at The Waterfront. This event is free, so it's an awesome day to head down on Labor Day Weekend to shop, see a movie and cheer on these skilled combatants. If you're reading this afterwards, check out their Facebook page which is always updated with upcoming events. Or, if you're ready to become a fighter yourself, send Chris an email to get started. I hope to see you cheering alongside me at the next Pittsburgh Armored Combat competition as we can see, in my favorite quote from A Knight's Tale , who is weighed, who is measured and who is found wanting.

Pittsburgh's biggest baseball legend is Roberto Clemente and his impact on baseball and on Pittsburgh still remain. The Pittsburgh Pirates celebrate Roberto Clemente Day away at the Mets Sept. 15, 2022. In 2023, all 30 MLB teams will play on Roberto Clemente Day Sept. 15, 2023, including the Pirates hosting the Yankees at PNC Park . Twenty-One. To some this is just a number. To Pittsburgh and the baseball community, that number is a legacy. On any given day you can walk down the street and see people sporting the number 21 on their backs, from kids to Moms, Dads, Grandpas and Grandmas. It is a Pittsburgh tradition: The famous Pirates Right Fielder Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker wore the number 21. 50th Anniversary of Clemente's 3000th Hit 2022 is a massive year Clemente's legacy. The city of Pittsburgh, Major League Baseball and his home country of Puerto Rico will all celebrate the 50th anniversary of Clemente's 3,000th hit with celebrations, special exhibits, statues, films and more. In the city, make plans to visit The Clemente Museum now through the end of the year for a brand new display. As soon as you enter, you'll see a giant scoreboard commemorating this iconic moment, with a video showing the hit flanked by gigantic photos taken by the two photographers covering the game that day. Insider Tip: Take special note of the rightmost bat laying on the baseball diamond to the left of the exhibit. That's the legendary bat Clemente used for this tremendous achievement. On Thursday, Sept. 8, the Clemente Museum will also host their Annual Fundraiser . Support the amazing work this museum does for the Pittsburgh community through your donations and look for limited edition bottles from Engine House 25 Wine, exclusive auctions and more great ways to contribute. Also worth checking out is Roberto Clemente: Keeping the Dream Alive , a new feature and documentary from TribLive about the challenges facing Clemente's legacy and the importance of his impact generationally in Puerto Rico. Roberto Clemente's History Clemente was born in Puerto Rico, and was the youngest of his seven siblings. He developed an interest for baseball during his youth when playing ball with neighboring kids. His love and talent for the sport led him to be recruited to play softball with the Sello Rojo team playing shortstop. By the young age of 16 he was already playing in Puerto Rico's amateur league. He began his professional career when he signed with the Cangrejeros de Santurce in 1952, during the season the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with one of their Triple-A affiliates. So began his famous American baseball career. He moved to Montreal to play with the Royals. At the time, he barely spoke any English and was assisted by infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black. Clemente and the Pittsburgh Pirates He finally debuted on the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 17th, 1955. At first, he didn't sport the famous 21. He wore the number 13. When it came time to change his number, he picked 21 because there are 21 letters in his full name: 'Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker'. In the 1960 season Clemente led the league in batting averages and led the Pirates to a 95-59 record year, winning the NL pennant. He and his teammates defeated the New York Yankees in a long seven game series, Clemente with a batting average of .310. He earned a sport on the NL All-Star roster after his performance. Then came the 1970 season, the last year of baseball that would ever be played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium. In the final game at the field on June 28th, 1970, Clemente felt very emotional about the moving of stadiums, stating that \"I spent half my life there.\" To honor Clemente the Pirates declared July 24, 1970 as \"Roberto Clemente Night\". Tons of his Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium wearing their Clemente gear. The Pirates held a ceremony where Clemente received a scroll of 300,000 signatures from Puerto Rico with thousands of dollars being donated to charity work, at the request of Roberto Clemente. This season the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were eventually eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. The following season, Clemente lead the Prates to another World Series beating the Orioles. He received the World Series' Most Valuable Player Award after his amazing efforts. In Clemente's final baseball season of his life he recorded his 3,000th hit in the 4th inning of the September 30th, 1972 game against the New York Mets. This would be his last regular season at-bat hit. His final game was October 11th, 1972 against the Cincinnati Red's. Why Pittsburgh Loves Roberto Clemente Clemente was not only known for his baseball talent, he was also known for giving back to the community. He was very involved in delivering relief packages to to the people of Managua, Nicaragua after they were affected by a earthquake. Clemente learned that some of the aid packages weren't making it to the victims so he accompanied the team to Nicaragua on the 4th relief flight on New Years Eve. The plane crashed due to mechanical errors, and Roberto Clemente and the four others on the plane died. The baseball world was forever changed. Clemente is honored all throughout Pittsburgh. A bridge is named after him, PNC Park has a statue dedicated to him, and there is a Roberto Clemente Museum. The Pirates and Major League Baseball do so much to honor this national hero. They have an award named after him \"The Clemente Award\" that is presented to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement\". Roberto Clemente not only shaped the game of baseball, he shaped Pittsburgh and Puerto Rico. He supported his Latino community and Pittsburgh community with full efforts. Five Ways to Celebrate Roberto Clemente in Pittsburgh: Visit the Roberto Clemente Museum and indulge in some \"Clemente Label\" wine Take a stroll across the Roberto Clemente Bridge Catch a Pirates game and grab a photo with the Roberto Clemente Statue outside of PNC Park Experience the \"Beat 'Em Bucs\" exhibit at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center Pick Roberto Clemente out of a lineup of the \" Legends of Pittsburgh \", a mural highlighting the 'Burgh's all time best baseball players.

My first impression was shock at just how massive the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is. Guests enter via the B Suite gates right next to the Pro Shop, and the stage is set by a stadium seating hype video before turning guests loose into the museum proper. Long corridors twist and turn through rare artifacts, many on display for the first time, as well as retellings and recreations of the biggest moments of the team. Here's just a few reasons why this museum is a must-see Only in Pittsburgh attraction. A Complete Steelers History When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team. The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome. In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again. Jump, Cheer and Yell with Interactive Exhibits With three energetic kids, a stuffy, quiet museum is not an option. Luckily, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is family-friendly and perfect for even the most boisterous fans on game day. Interactive displays let guests select the era they're interested in, scroll timelines of important events and re-live impactful moments like one section dedicated entirely to the Immaculate Reception. Think you can outdo Myron Cope? Enter the broadcast booth and pick a classic play which you can then do commentary on! At the end, the display plays back video and audio of how you did, which is sure to bring lots of laughs. Near the end of the Museum, interactive displays let you measure up to the Steelers, encouraging you to run out of the entrance tunnel and jump as high as you can just like you're taking the field at Acrisure to a raucous crowd. Honoring Steelers Legends After you're done viewing all six Super Bowl rings, the final part of the exhibit is perhaps the true highlight. A massive wall of bronzed footballs enshrines each member of the Hall of Honor, with multiple displays that let you select a person, scroll through a timeline of their life and play videos of some of their most memorable moments. Diehard Steelers fans, you can easily spend an hour or two just in this room. With new members added yearly (and hopefully a new Super Bowl ring to add soon), there's a new reason to tour the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum each season. Plan Your Visit Ready to tour? The Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is open Wednesday-Monday from 11 a.m.-4 p.m. and passes can be booked online . Tours happen on the hour and the last tour of the day begins at 3 p.m. Please Note: The museum will be closed on University of Pittsburgh home games. Tours last about one hour, and all guests receive 10% off the Steelers Pro Shop on the bottom floor when they present their passes. Passes are $18 for adults, $15 for seniors/military, $12 for kids 6-17 and free for 5 and under. Group tours are also available.

You can celebrate these Pro Football Hall of Famers and other Pittsburgh greats in the City of Champions all year long . The Steelers recently opened their own Hall of Honor to recognize all the great contributors to this historic franchise. From the Immaculate Reception monument and photo ops with The Chief outside Acrisure Stadium to a visit to the Western PA Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center , there is no shortage of ways to experience Steelers history in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Football Hall of Fame Inductees 2021 Class: Five members of the Pittsburgh Steelers were enshrined at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021. Pittsburgh legends Bill Cowher, Donnie Shell and Troy Polamalu were honored with the Centennial Class of 2020. Alan Faneca and Bill Nunn were honored with the 2021 class. The celebrations took place at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio. Alan Faneca joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1998 and enjoyed a 206-game career in the three rivers city. Faneca started 14 playoff games, including four AFC championship games and a Steelers victory in Super Bowl XL. One of the best offensive linemen in franchise history, Faneca was a six-time, first-team All-Pro during his years with the Steelers; he was voted to nine Pro Bowls overall. Legendary journalist and Steelers scout Bill Nunn was recognized with a video tribute as the first Black Contributor in the 100-year history of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Nunn served 18 years as Pittsburgh\u2019s assistant personnel director, then 23 years as a semiretired scout. Nunn also was inducted into the Black College Hall of Fame in 2010. 2020 Class: Pittsburgh native Bill Cowher was the head coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for 15 seasons from 1992 to 2006. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers became the first team ever to win nine road games and the first sixth-seeded team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl, defeating the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10, in Super Bowl XL. Donnie Shell joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1974 as a free agent. Shell capped his career with 51 interceptions, becoming the first strong safety in the history of the National Football League to surpass the 50-interception mark. His 51 career interceptions rank him third in Steelers history behind Hall of Famer Mel Blount (57) and Jack Butler (52). Troy Polamalu spent his entire 12-year professional football career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Polamalu was a defensive leader who guided the Steelers to seven playoff appearances, five division titles and helped them win two of their three most-recent Super Bowl appearances \u2013 XL and XLIII.

He was the Steelers starting QB, and the face of a historic franchise, for 18 years. He\u2019s threw for over 63,000 yards and 417 touchdowns. His overall record is 165-81-1 and he\u2019s been in six Pro Bowls. Steelers fans\u2019 favorite Ben stat? He won two Super Bowls. He will be eligible for the HOF in 2027 and has a shot at getting in on his first try. Maurkice Pouncey: Big Ben\u2019s right-hand man, Center Maurkice Pouncey made the 2010s All-Decade Team. He is a 9x Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro selection. He'll be eligible for the HOF starting in 2026. Art Rooney Jr. and Buddy Parker: Both were finalists in the 2023 class. Rooney Jr. has been with the Steelers from 1965 to this day. He was the Steelers Personnel Director until 1985 and played a pivotal rule in crafting the Steelers 70s Super Bowl winning teams. Parker coached the Steelers, Detroit Lions, and Chicago Cardinals from 1949-1964. His career record was 104-75-9. Hines Ward: Hines has been knocking on the door for a few years now. Although he doesn\u2019t have many individual accolades, he does have a huge list of intangibles as well as two Super Bowl rings and a Super Bowl MVP to his name. James Harrison: The fan-favorite OLB was the 2008 NFL Defensive Player of the year. He is also a five-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro, and of course, has two Super Bowl Rings. Mike Tomlin: Tomlin has built up a coaching resume that is as impressive as his predecessors Bill Cowher and Chuck Noll. Going into the 2024 season, he is now the longest tenured head coach in the NFL, and amazingly still doesn\u2019t have a losing season. He is a Super Bowl champion and has a great overall record of 173-100-2. Although he is probably far from retirement, he already has a Hall of Fame coaching resume at the age of 52. T.J. Watt: Watt is only 29, but you can't deny these stats: six-time Pro Bowler, three-time league leader in sacks and two-time league leader in tackles for loss and the Defensive Player of the Year in 2021. A few more seasons of this pedigree and Canton is going to be adding some more black and gold very soon. TJ Watt coming out of the entrance tunnel.

The same is true across two rivers at Highmark Stadium to support the Pittsburgh Riverhounds pro soccer team! From mid-October on, the Pittsburgh Penguins NHL team also plays in our Uptown neighborhood at PPG Paints Arena. Or, check out the Pitt Panthers who also play at Acrisure in ACC action! Pro Tip: Look at all our sports team schedules before you visit to see who else might be able to see while you're in town! Head Under our Friday Night Lights If you live and breathe football, you're in luck. Pittsburgh and the surrounding region is a hotbed of high school football activity, with powerhouse teams, NFL Draft-caliber talent and rivalries that pack the stadium. Find schedules of our games on local news sites or through the WPIAL to see our own Friday Night Lights. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Aaron Caldwell (@aac_creative) Go On a Brew Tour Beer and football have always went hand-in-hand, but if you're in town for a Steelers game you're also lucky enough to be in one of the top craft beer cities in the country. Follow the Pittsburgh Brewers Guild for pre-made trails that let you explore a unique neighborhood and sampling their best suds. I'd recommend starting with their North Shore Trail, which allows you to sip six of my favorite brews all throughout our stadium district where the Steelers play. North Shore Trail courtesy of the Pittsburgh Breweries website If you have time to venture outside of the city, book a tour at Pittsburgh Brewing Co. , the home of I.C. Light and Iron City Beer, for a behind-the-scenes tour of this AI-enhanced, state-of-the-art brewery. A beautiful sight as IC Light is canned, boxed and shipped right in front of you. Eat Like a Local Food is serious business in Pittsburgh. We love our regional delicacies from pierogis and french fry-filled sandwiches to gobs and chipped ham. As our city grew and populations shifted, you can now find international cuisine, fine dining and Pittsburgh staples all on the same street. My favorite way to enjoy all of our local favorites combines both our dining scene and the Steelers. Follow our guide to the Strip District and walk around to our various markets and restaurants (and don't forget some local beer), then bring your bounty to the lots outside Acrisure Stadium for the ultimate tailgate. Visit The Great One While Pittsburgh is no stranger to hall of famers and all stars, we have an entire museum dedicated to Roberto Clemente, housed in a historic firehouse and full of memorabilia from The Great One himself. Make sure to add on the wine tasting at the Clemente Museum for the full experience and keep an eye out for celebrity gear not just from Clemente but other baseball and Pittsburgh sports legends as you explore. Ok, we've went over the plays and you should have your itinerary in hand. Time to break this huddle. We'll see you out there exploring the city and inside Acrisure Stadium screaming for the black and gold alongside us.

The Immaculate Reception On Dec. 23, 1972, the Pittsburgh Steelers played their first playoff game in franchise history against the Oakland Raiders. Just as the clock ran out, fullback Franco Harris scooped up the ball and ran for a touchdown that will forever be known as the Immaculate Reception. You can visit the memorial of this historic play in the exact spot where it happened on the site of the old Three Rivers Stadium near Acrisure Stadium.

A Tradition of Excellence Steelers Trivia Here are some of our favorite Steelers facts for your next trivia night: Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognized symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Steelers Tip: The Towel is for waving or decorating, not for drying your hands or using for any other towel-like purpose, which is believed to bring back luck. Sometime during the fourth quarter before a big play or series, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Heinz Field. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. The tradition dates back to a 2002 comeback win against the Cleveland Browns. Make sure to visit the FedEx Great Hall inside Heinz Field; it's basically a shrine to the greatest moments in football history with Super Bowl trophies, jerseys, rings and more on display. In Pittsburgh, Big Ben was our 2x Super Bowl-winning quarterback, not a clock. Steelers aren't just inventive in their get-up, we also like to give incredible moments in football nicknames like The Immaculate Reception, The Steel Curtain, and, most recently in honor of six Super Bowl Championships, Sixburgh. While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo . Each of the hypocycloids represent one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore, and steel scrape is illustrated with blue. During games, you'll hear fans chanting \"Here We Go, Steelers!\" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. Here We Go, originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. Having sold more than 120,000 copies of the original, Here We Go is now regularly updated to mention current players' names and has become an anthem for the team during playoffs. Whether you're visiting for a game or just happen to be around the city during football season, you're sure to enjoy the unique Steelers atmosphere. To get a full taste of the football culture here in the 'Burgh, I encourage you head to Acrisure Stadium for a game or at least visit Stage AE for a free tailgate open before, during, and after home games. Plus, you can sign up for Steelers Nation Unite to earn exclusive rewards near and far from Pittsburgh. Here We Go Steelers!

Enjoy a bite of our Only in Pittsburgh offerings at Chicken on the Hill, which features a menu inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District. Order the pimento friend chicken sandwich and thank us later. Deli Dogs (inspired by Smallman Street Deli ) offers upscale takes on the classic ballpark hot dog, with high-quality dogs and buns served Reuben, Chicago and chili style. And, ballpark nachos get kicked up a notch by Nachoritas with queso and crema for a satisfying addition. And that's just the beginning! Read our full recap of what to eat section by section of the stadium for a full look at the flavors of PNC Park. PPG Paints Arena When the Pittsburgh Penguins hit the ice at the PPG Paints Arena, there\u2019s no shortage of food for fans to enjoy. Check out the meatballs at Emporio: A Meatball Joint . One of Pittsburgh\u2019s best sushi restaurants, Nakama , has two locations in the arena where fresh rolls and sashimi are made throughout the game.

If you\u2019re craving pizza, check out Franco\u2019s Pizzeria, which features three Steelers\u2019 themed pies: The Immaculate Pie, Gina Margarita & PeppeRooney Pizza. If beer isn\u2019t your preferred beverage, Acrisure Stadium features a diverse wine selection at the North Shore Winery stand. Also worth checking out at Acrisure are the Potato Patch Fries just like Kennywood does 'em (Section 106), Pierogi House for a Pittsburgh staple (Section 119) and the spicy chicken & waffle sandwich (Club seats). Pro Tip: Use the Steelers Official Mobile App to order your next beer or snack so you can skip the line, pick-up by scanning your bar code and be back in your seat before you can say Franco's Italian Army.

            "title": "Pittsburgh Pirates",
            "description": " The Pittsburgh Pirates are an American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh. The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central Division. Founded as part of the American Association in 1881 under the name Pittsburgh Alleghenys, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the National League East from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five World Series championships, nine National League pennants, nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the Wild Card Game. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first title in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in 1971 behind Roberto Clemente, the first Latin-American enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 1979 under the leadership of Willie Stargell. Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from 1993 to 2012, a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues. The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League, and the longest League Championship Series appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2024, the Pirates have an overall record of 10, 839\u201310, 819\u2013140 (. 500 winning 'percentage'). The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer, a synonym for pirate). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at PNC Park, a 39, 000-seat stadium along the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side. The Pirates previously played at Forbes Field from 1909 to 1970 and at Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the flag of Pittsburgh and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the Steelers and the Penguins. Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (rarely the \"Alleghenies\") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A. A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League's Pittsburgh Burghers. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the A. A. 's Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\". This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A. A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels, who were slated for elimination when the N. L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions. ) Among those players was Honus Wagner, who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played, which they lost to Boston. The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909, defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field. As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51\u2013103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925, becoming the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit in the World Series. The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees. The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season. Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960. They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees, yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2022, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history. Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente, the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971. Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium, the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass. In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup. Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, and 1979. Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, and Al Oliver, the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company. \" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song \"We Are Family\" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis). The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, and Doug Drabek. The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992. Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season. With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park, did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen, defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game. They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals. That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10, 000 all-time wins. On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10, 000th making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then. Since 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at PNC Park, located on the banks of the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging Three Rivers Stadium, a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics. Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services. PNC Park's listed capacity is 38, 747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40, 000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the 2015 National League Wild Card Game, when 40, 889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4\u20130. Widely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline. PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953; as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher, and seating along the baselines is 45 feet from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder Roberto Clemente, who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, Willie Stargell, Bill Mazeroski and Honus Wagner are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the 2006 MLB All-Star Game and has been the site of several concerts. PNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from downtown Pittsburgh via the Clemente Bridge, or take Pittsburgh Light Rail to the system's North Side station, located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance. The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series. In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland, which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation. Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23, 000 in 1909 to 41, 000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35, 000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field. When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected. Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth's career on May 25, 1935 and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh \"Pitt\" Panthers. Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall. The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE, although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium. In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3, 000th hit. Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida, which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders. Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach, which dates to 1914. It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park, built in 1912, and Wrigley Field, built in 1914. Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights. The park was formerly named \"McKechnie Field, \" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie, who led the Pirates in 1925; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and also a campus in Bradenton. Pirate City, the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park. The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century. During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket. The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942. In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League. The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924, but the change did not last beyond that season. Along with the San Francisco Giants, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009. In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit). The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch. In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes. After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys, following the Oakland Athletics. Starting in 1977, the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series. The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since. After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009, the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road. From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019. Since the 2015 season, the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games. The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season, now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches. Ahead of the 2020 season, the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow. In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park. In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted \"Y\", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous \"Steelmark\" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh. The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994. It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies. The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969\u20131993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s. The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span. After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry. The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds, given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry, and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason, most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches, occasionally resulting in brawls. From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of the 1938 season. The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers. While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986\u20131996) and the Tigers (2005\u20132013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36\u201329. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series. An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically. The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule. The Pirates lead the series 21\u201318.

Like the Washington Nationals with the Ring of Honor, the Pirates inducted players that had played for the Negro league baseball team Homestead Grays, which had played in Forbes Field and Greenlee Field in Pittsburgh alongside their time in Washington; two of the first class also spent time with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, with a ceremony dedicated to \"signing\" the four to Pirates contracts. All inductees were honored with a plaque displayed in the concourse by the entrance with the statue of Roberto Clemente. The Pittsburgh Pirates farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates. Throughout the 1940s Pirates owner William Benswanger was a leading advocate of integration of the Major Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club. The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963, the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh. On September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minority players for the first time in MLB history. Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin, the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams. However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century. While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s, the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped. The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001. Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season. When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium. Each year, the Pirates recognize six \"Community Champions\" during a special pregame ceremony. Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, \"Ask Pirates Management\", and appearances by the Pirate Parrot. Piratefest was once held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh but is now held annually at the ballpark. The Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio on August 5, 1921. Harold Arlin, a foreman at Westinghouse, announced the game over KDKA from a box seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field. KDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with Rosey Rowswell becoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936. Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50, 000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games. In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM talk radio station WPGB. The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25\u201354 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters. On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM, which became official on October 12. On March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM. As part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with Pittsburgh Panthers football and men's basketball. Games are televised on SportsNet Pittsburgh, the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. The network is majority owned by Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Pirates became joint owners of the channel on December 16, 2023, with operations to be produced by the Red Sox's home network NESN. During the 2016 season, the Pirates averaged a 7. 22 rating and 83, 000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts. Apart from any Pirates games aired nationally on Fox, there has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002. Previously, KDKA-TV aired Pirates games for 38 years (1957\u20131994). Games also aired on WPXI (1995\u20131996) and on WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997\u20132002). Current The Pirates have no set broadcast team for radio or TV; instead, all announcers and analysts take turns working in both mediums over the course of a season. The longest-tenured broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk, both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst, while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers. Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps, Kevin Young, and Neil Walker. Past Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter, usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955. Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team. Nicknamed \"The Gunner, \" Prince was known for his \"Gunnerisms\"\u2014nicknames and quips\u2014and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC. Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince. Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett, who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015. Former analysts include Don Hoak, Nelson Briles, and Jim Rooker. Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass, who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019."

The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC. In contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s. The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos and Dallas Cowboys for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight. The Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding. Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II. The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation. They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field. The Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants. Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than . 500 (1936). Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions. Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers. During World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \"Steagles\". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\"). This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history. The Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21\u20130. That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \"Playoff Bowl\" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff. In 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. The Steelers also received a $3 million ($23. 5 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team. The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season. Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970, Jack Ham in 1971, Franco Harris in 1972, and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Donnie Shell and Mike Webster. The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted five future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year. The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two. They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins (1971\u20131979) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year. The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record. The 1981 season was no better, with an 8\u20138 showing. The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. \"Mean\" Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984's AFC Championship Game appearance. After those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above . 500 in 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1987, the year of the players' strike, the Steelers finished with a record of 8\u20137, but missed the playoffs. In 1989, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons. Noll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209\u2013156\u20131. In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton. Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the \"Blitzburgh\" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later. With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8\u20138 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship. Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149\u201390\u20131 in the regular season and 161\u201399\u20131 overall, including playoff games. On January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term \"retire\", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team. A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy. On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach. Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history. In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10\u20136 record and AFC North title. The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31\u201329 in the Wild Card Round to end the season. The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12\u20134 mark and a division title. With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship, Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27\u201323 against the Arizona Cardinals. At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first). In their title defense, the Steelers went 9\u20137 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season. In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12\u20134 record and an AFC North title. The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship. Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31\u201325. In the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12\u20134 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round. The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins. Overall, the Steelers went 8\u20138 and missed the postseason in 2012. In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8\u20138 and missed the postseason. In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11\u20135 record. They lost 30\u201317 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round. The Steelers finished with a 10\u20136 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season. They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11\u20135 record. They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13\u20133 mark. Their postseason was short lived with a 45\u201342 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite a 9\u20136\u20131 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs. The Steelers went 8\u20138 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season. The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11\u20130 start. However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12\u20134. The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48\u201337. The 2021 season saw the team go 9\u20137\u20131 and make the postseason. The Steelers lost 42\u201321 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season. Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162\u201394\u20132 (. 632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013\u201317 seasons were noted for record performances from the \"Killer B's\". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell. Occasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals. Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9\u20138 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season. In the 2023 season, the team finished 10\u20137 and third in the AFC North. They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31\u201317. Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos. Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444\u2013282\u20132 (. 635) and an overall record of 480\u2013305\u20132 (. 635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations. Dan Rooney, and his son, Art Rooney II, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers \u2013 Timothy and Patrick \u2013 wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York. Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines, causing them to violate \"NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests\". Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time: Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams: Through the end of the 2023 season, the Steelers have an all-time record of 707\u2013606\u201322, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times. In the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger. The Steelers are 36\u201326 (. 580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger. The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam), [a] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002). The Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division. The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the \"Steagles\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag. The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \"Steelmark\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U. S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world. \" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel. While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI. The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey. The 2007\u20132011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963\u20131964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only. In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season. Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants. In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed. In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors. The Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: (Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years. The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9\u201331 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66\u201327\u20131 (including 42\u20136 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75\u201358\u20131; The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970\u201385) and 15 (2004\u2013present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021. Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable match-ups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20\u201313, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13\u201310. Later that season (2001) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27\u201310 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16\u20130, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9\u20136, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32\u201324. The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3\u20131 record. The Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFL\u2013NFL merger was completed. In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7\u20133 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31\u201317 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play. The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38\u201331, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11\u20135 and 8\u20138 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18\u201316 Steelers comeback victory. The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63\u201335. The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times. The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28\u20133 while the Steelers won 7\u20136 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30\u201314 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15\u20131 regular season. The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998\u20132007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33\u201310 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55\u201331. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28\u201321) and 2016's regular season (27\u201316), and then won 36\u201317 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back. Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17\u201310 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh. In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135\u201375, with the Patriots maintaining a 4\u20131 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2\u20131), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2\u20130), and the Broncos (5\u20133). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15\u201313 against the Patriots. In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12\u20134 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33\u20133 on Sunday Night Football. Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34\u201331 playoff showdown in 2002); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997\u20132001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27\u201324 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020. The Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23\u201313. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35\u201335 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34\u201321. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33\u201310 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium; the Steelers pulled the upset 24\u201317. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24\u201323. In 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, where Denver squeaked out at 24\u201321 win. Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34\u201317 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31\u201319 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20\u201313\u20131, including 5\u20133 in the playoffs. Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27\u201319. The Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13\u20137 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time. The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33\u201314 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24\u201313) and 1975 (16\u201310) to reach the Super Bowl. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24\u20137 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Oakland's George Atkinson as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38\u201310 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury. While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after 2002), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20\u201313), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27\u201324 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35\u20133, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31\u201321 gap to win 34\u201331. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21\u201318. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38\u201335 at Heinz Field. In their most recent matchups, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24\u201321 on December 9, 2018, in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth. The Raiders won at Pittsburgh September 19, 2021, 26\u201317, then fell on Christmas Eve 2022 at Pittsburgh 13\u201310 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett. A lifeless performance in a 23\u201318 loss at Vegas September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler. As of the 2023 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17\u201315. The Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in 1960 (against the Steelers) at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a 35\u201328 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21\u201317 and Super Bowl XIII 35\u201331. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 \u2013 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner, defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1977, Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28\u201313 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14\u20133 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27\u201317. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (2004 and 2008) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13\u201313, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27\u201324 margin in overtime and won 35\u201330 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17\u201316. The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film Black Sunday, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24\u201319 margin. The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35\u201313. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49\u201329\u20133. Prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot. As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70, 000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team. Diane Roles of Middlesex Township, submitted the winning name which was \"meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, \"Mc\" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for Jim Beam, her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage. \" Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events. Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized S, and the L is drawn to look like a beam of steel. The Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN. com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities. The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season. The Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but \"Steeler bars\" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams. The Terrible Towel has been described by the Associated Press as \"arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team\". Conceived of by broadcaster Myron Cope in 1975, the towel's rights have since been given to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, which cares for over 900 people with intellectual disability and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son. Since 1996, proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2. 5 million for the school. The Steelers have no official fight song, but many fan versions of \"Here We Go Steelers\" and the \"Steelers Polka\" (the latter a parody of \"Pennsylvania Polka\") by ethnic singer Jimmy Pol, both originating in the 1970s, have been recorded. Since 1994, the song \"Here We Go\" by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans. Since 2002, the 1979 Styx song \"Renegade\" is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper Wiz Khalifa, \"Black and Yellow\", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience. The Steelers were the first NFL team to have a cheerleading squad, they were known as the Steelerettes. Their run only lasted from 1961 to 1969. To this day, they were the only cheerleaders the team had in their history. During the offseason, the Steelers have long participated in charity basketball games throughout Western Pennsylvania and neighboring areas. The games usually feature six active players as well as their player-coach playing against a group of local civic leaders. The players, whose participants aren't announced until the day of the game, sign free autographs for fans during halftime. In 2001, the Steelers moved into Heinz Field. The franchise dating back to 1933 has had several homes. For 31 seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside. The team moved to what was then known as Heinz Field in 2001. In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium. The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe. The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI. com describing it as: \". . . I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania, an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland. Classic, wonderful slice of American culture. If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see. \" The team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside. Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team. In 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season. The Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s. In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices. During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director) and suburban Ligonier also served as a pre-season training camp sites.

The team retired Greene's #75 in 2014 and left the possibility open that they would retire other players' jersey numbers at later dates. However, several numbers have not been reissued since the retirement of the players who wore them, including: The Steelers boast the third most \"primary\" inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, i. e. inductees that spent most or all of their NFL careers in Pittsburgh. They also can claim the most honorees of any franchise founded on or after 1933 and the only franchise with three members of ownership in the Hall of Fame. The following Steelers players have been named to the Pro Bowl:  The following Steelers were named to NFL All-Decade Teams (and 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams, selected in 1994 and 2019, respectively). Only those who spent time with Pittsburgh during the respective decades are listed. Bold indicates those elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.     In 2007, in celebration of the franchise's 75th season, the team announced an updated All-Time team of the 33 best players who have ever played for the Steelers. This team supplanted the previous All-Time team of 24 players named as part of the 50th anniversary commemoration in 1982. A \"Legends team\" consisting of the club's best pre-1970s players was released concurrently with the latest All-Time team. The regional Dapper Dan Charities has since 1939 named the \"Sportsman of the Year\" in the Pittsburgh region. 19 Steelers have won the award in 23 events: The Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Honor was established on August 1, 2017. There have been 57 inductees. The Steelers have had 16 coaches through their history. They have cycled through the fewest head coaches in the modern NFL history. Their first coach was Forrest Douds, who coached them to a 3\u20136\u20132 record in 1933. Chuck Noll had the longest term as head coach with the Steelers; he is one of only four coaches to coach a single NFL team for 23 years. Hired prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers current coach is Mike Tomlin. \u2192 Coaching staff \u2192 Front office \u2192 More NFL staffs Source: Source: As of 2006, the Steelers' flagship radio stations were WDVE 102. 5 FM and WBGG 970 AM.

Craig Wolfley is the sideline reporter. Myron Cope, the longtime color analyst and inventor of the \"Terrible Towel\", retired after the 2004 season, and died in 2008. Longtime lead announcer Bill Hillgrove retired after the 2023 season. Pre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV, channel 2; independent sister station WPKD-TV, channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program Steelers Kickoff during the regular season prior to the national airing of The NFL Today. Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the Xfinity Xtra Point following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh.

The Steelers hold a national contract with Grupo Imagen for radio rights to their games in Mexico; Imagen broadcasts the Steelers on their stations in 17 Mexican cities. The Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope, who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons (1970\u20132004). Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. The Steelers Digest is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers. com page. The Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films: The protagonist of John Grisham's novel The Associate is a staunch Steelers fan. In the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain. The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'. The Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1 million.

            "title": "Pittsburgh Penguins",
            "description": " The Pittsburgh Penguins (colloquially known as the Pens) are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh. The Penguins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference, and have played their home games at PPG Paints Arena, originally known as Consol Energy Center, since 2010. The team previously played at the Civic Arena, which was also known as Mellon Arena from 1999 to 2010, and by its nickname \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are affiliated with two minor league teams \u2013 the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL. Founded during the 1967 expansion, the Penguins have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times \u2013 in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017. Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Stanley Cup championships among the non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the salary cap era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, including co-owner Mario Lemieux, who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Sidney Crosby, and Evgeni Malkin have won the Hart Memorial Trophy while playing for the franchise. Prior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates from 1925 to 1930 and of the American Hockey League's Pittsburgh Hornets franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, Jack McGregor, a state senator from Kittanning, Pennsylvania, began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an urban renewal tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included H. J. Heinz Company heir H. J. Heinz III, Pittsburgh Steelers' owner Art Rooney and the Mellon family's Richard Mellon Scaife. The projected league expansion depended on securing votes from the then-current NHL owners; to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from James D. Norris, owner of the Chicago Black Hawks and his brother Bruce Norris, owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the National Hockey League awarded an expansion team to Pittsburgh for the 1967\u201368 season. The Penguins paid $2. 5 million ($23. 8 million today) for their entry and $750, 000 ($6. 9 million today) more for start-up costs. The Civic Arena's capacity was boosted from 10, 732 to 12, 500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Pens also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors. A contest was held where 700 of 26, 000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the athletic department of the newly named Youngstown State University in nearby Youngstown, Ohio. (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the Cleveland Barons in the mid-1970s. ) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena), a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \"Golden Triangle\" of downtown Pittsburgh. The Penguins' first general manager, Jack Riley, opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in Brantford, Ontario, on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Pens, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper Andy Bathgate, all-star defenseman Leo Boivin (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and New York Rangers' veteran Earl Ingarfield, a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers Val Fonteyne and Ab McDonald, and goaltenders Hank Bassen and Joe Daley. George Sullivan was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain. On October 11, 1967, league president Clarence Campbell and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the Montreal Canadiens. On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4\u20132. However, the Penguins went 27\u201334\u201313 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime Cleveland Barons AHL goaltender Les Binkley, who recorded a 2. 88 goals-against average and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger Ken Schinkel won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the NHL All-Star Game. Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for center Lou Angotti. The next season saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players\u2014including longtime future Pens star Jean Pronovost\u2014making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains. In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001. In the 1970\u201371 season, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21\u201337\u201320 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr. , Keith McCreary, agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972. The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button. Button obtained Steve Durbano, Ab DeMarco, Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28\u201341\u20139 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth. However, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into bankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate. Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 1976\u201377 season. Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals in 1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. Baz Bastien, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977\u201378. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins. The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980. On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle, and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else. During the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3\u20131 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli, who had tied the game before. It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance until 1989. The team had the league's worst record in both the 1982\u201383 and 1983\u201384 seasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate. Mario Lemieux, one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the New Jersey Devils, who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management. Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted. Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman Paul Coffey from the Edmonton Oilers (after the Oilers' 1987 Stanley Cup win) and bringing in young talent like scorers Kevin Stevens, Rob Brown and John Cullen from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of Tom Barrasso from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Pens; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. The 1985\u201386 Pens missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In 1986\u201387, they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In 1987\u201388, for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game. In 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Pens shocked the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game. A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989\u201390 season, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings (Bryan Trottier) and trades (Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent. The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games, punctuated by an 8\u20130 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush, the first NHL team ever to visit the White House. The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer, and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991\u201392. Cancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was tragically diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56\u201321\u20137 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, the New York Islanders eliminated them in the second round of Game 7 in overtime. The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev, Martin Straka, Aleksey Morozov, Robert Lang and Petr Nedved, and defensemen Sergei Zubov, Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games. On April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin. The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4\u20131 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20132 in the second round. By this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998. Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32. 5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity\u2014enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time. Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player\u2013owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs, highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils. The Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998\u201399, the club had an average attendance of 14, 825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year. Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The following season they finished second-last. In the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with the first overall pick. The 2003\u201304 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11, 877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout. As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator) Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL Entry Draft (Alexander Ovechkin), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center Evgeni Malkin, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut. By this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City, Missouri. A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 2004\u201305 NHL season. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators, which had filed for bankruptcy protection. During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and to European leagues. With the lockout resolved in 2005, the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the 2005 NHL Entry Draft selection order. The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a \"secure location\", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick. Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) superstar Sidney Crosby (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer) was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh. The Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the Russian Superleague. The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4, 000 per game on average in the 2005\u201306 season. However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to Michel Therrien. Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an irregular heartbeat, this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1, 723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1, 033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1. 88), which is second to Wayne Gretzky's 1. 92. Despite the team's struggles, Crosby established himself as a star in the league, amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, and selected touted two-way forward Jordan Staal. The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager Craig Patrick, who had been the general manager since December 1989. On May 25, Ray Shero signed a five-year contract as general manager. Change came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games. The Penguins finished the 2006\u201307 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47\u201324\u201311, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4\u20131. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won. On March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's Governor Ed Rendell, Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center, guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040. After a mediocre start to the 2007\u201308 season, Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title\u2014their first division title in 10 years\u2014with a 4\u20132 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4\u20130, defeating the New York Rangers 4\u20131 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4\u20131 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy. Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14\u20136 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe Trophy-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead. In the 2008\u201309 season, Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, like the previous years, the Penguins won Games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in Games 5 and 6. In Game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2\u20131 to win their third Stanley Cup title. Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs. During the 2009\u201310 season, Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive Game 7, which the Penguins lost 5\u20132, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena. In 2010\u201311, the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center. On February 11, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins\u2013New York Islanders brawl took place. A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3\u20131 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning, with Fleury's goaltending called into question. With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome, at the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award. Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft for the upcoming 2012\u201313 season. During the lockout-shortened 2012\u201313 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the Conference Finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9. 5 million. In the 2013\u201314 season, the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division, though the club struggled in the playoffs, requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3\u20131 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014\u201315 season, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the Division. The Pens lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel. After acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015\u201316 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15\u201310\u20133 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan, who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford. The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs, the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4\u20131 series, the Capitals 4\u20132 and the Lightning 4\u20133 to win the Eastern Conference Championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks. On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4\u20132 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy. The Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs, defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the Conference Finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997\u201398 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era. Before the 2017\u201318 season, the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft to the Vegas Golden Knights. Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. In the next season, the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the First Round. In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the Qualifying Round. On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1, 000 NHL games for the team. The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs. The 2020\u201321 season came to an end in Game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the New York Islanders. On November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins. In the First Round, the Penguins lost in seven games to the New York Rangers despite having a 3\u20131 series lead. The Game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a Game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6\u20130 the previous six instances. The 2022\u201323 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1, 000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1, 000th game in a Penguins uniform. This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1, 000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005\u201306, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in Burke and Hextall's dismissals. On June 1, 2023, Kyle Dubas was named the team's new president of hockey operations. On 6 August 2023, the Penguins traded for Norris Trophy winning defensemen Erik Karlsson in a three-team deal also involving the Montreal Canadiens. On February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL Trade Deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favourite forward Jake Guentzel, trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes. Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season after the Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, clinching the final spot as the second wild card. Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6, 000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16, 000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat. While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald, noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins. However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade. Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field. Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround) ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level. Considered by some to be the best rivalry in the NHL, the Philadelphia Flyers\u2013Pittsburgh Penguins rivalry began in 1967 when the teams were introduced in the NHL's \"Next Six\" expansion wave. The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in Pennsylvania. The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153\u201398-30 record. However, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the Conference Semi-finals. The franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 Patrick Division Finals, 4\u20133; 1997 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4\u20131; 2000 Eastern Conference Semi-finals, 4\u20132; and 2012 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4\u20132) and the Penguins winning three (2008 Eastern Conference Finals, 4\u20131; 2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, 4\u20132; and 2018 Eastern Conference First Round, 4\u20132). The two teams have faced off 11 times in the playoffs, with the Penguins winning nine of the 11 matchups, their two series losses coming in the 1994 and 2018 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to their five Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. The NHL's fourth Winter Classic, played on January 1, 2011, at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh showcased this rivalry. The Capitals won the game 3\u20131. The rivalry can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the Hershey Bears. When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word \"Pittsburgh\" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed. The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city. The Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983\u201384 season. In the 1992\u201393 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo, or \"Robopenguin\". The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the \"skating penguin\" logo, but with a \"Vegas gold\" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the \"skating penguin\" was readopted as the primary, though the \"flying penguin\" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995\u20132002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007\u201308 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders. The Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003\u201304 NHL season. The team wore their powder blue, 1968\u20131972 \"throwbacks\" against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 NHL Winter Classic. This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. For the 2011\u201312 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired. Called the \"Blue Jerseys of Doom\" by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms. In 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured \"Pittsburgh gold\", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black \"Pittsburgh gold\" alternates, thus retiring the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016\u201317 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. During the 2017 NHL Stadium Series against the archrival Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a \"City of Champions\" patch and a variation of the \"skating penguin\" logo. This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018\u201319 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms. The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 NHL Stadium Series. In 2021, the Penguins wore white \"Reverse Retro\" uniforms based on the 1992\u201397 uniforms. This set replaced the \"flying penguin\" with the alternate \"skating penguin\" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders. A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021\u201322 season. In the 2022\u201323 season, the Penguins unveiled their second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, this time featuring a black version of the white \"flying penguin\" uniform they wore from 1992 to 2002. For the 2023 NHL Winter Classic, the Penguins went with a vintage white uniform with black stripes, and added a gold \"P\" logo as a nod to the NHL Pirates of the late 1920s. The Penguins have their radio home on WXDX-FM and their television home on SportsNet Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network consists of a total of 34 stations in four states. Twenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in West Virginia, three in Ohio, and three in Maryland. The network also features an FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh. Local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV broadcast the Penguins during the 1967\u201368 season, with station Sports Director Ed Conway handling the play-by-play during both the television and radio broadcasts. He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968\u201369 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969\u201370 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970\u201371 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970\u201371 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a color commentator to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth. Mike Lange, who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974\u201375 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979\u201380 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972\u201373. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984\u201385, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. With Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman Peter Taglianetti. Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach Rick Kehoe after the 2002\u201303 season. With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired Bob Errey as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003\u201304 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005\u201306. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016\u201317 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016\u201317 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and NHL Network personality Steve Mears was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017\u201318 season. Lange retired in the 2021 off-season, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement. Phil Bourque serves as the radio color commentator. Before the 2023\u201324 season, Getzoff moved to the television booth with Mears replacing him on the radio. The Penguins did not retain TV analyst Bob Errey, choosing to go with a rotation of analysts featuring former Penguins Colby Armstrong, Mike Rupp and Phil Bourque. In 2024, Joe Brand replaced Steve Mears on the radio booth after Mears was hired by the Blue Jackets. Every Penguins game is carried on the AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. On October 2, 2023, the network will be purchased by the Penguins and rebranded to SportsNet Pittsburgh. In addition, Fox Sports Ohio simulcasts Penguins hockey in the Cleveland metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly \"game of the week\" national exposure on American networks ESPN, ESPN+, ABC, and TNT, and Canadian networks Sportsnet and CBC. Previously, the Penguins received national TV exposure on Fox, NBC and NBCSN in the U. S. , and TSN in Canada. Ryan Mill has been the Penguins\u2019 public address announcer since 2009 when he succeeded John Barbero. Jeff Jimerson has been the team's official anthem singer since 1991 and also served in the same capacity in the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Sudden Death. The Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to the state-of-the-art Consol Energy Center (now named the PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two \"home\" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh; the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s). From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home, and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training. In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228. The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play. As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center. The Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania, since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the ECHL, the Wheeling Nailers, which they have been associated with since the start of the 2000\u201301 season.
