    "title": "History of the Terrible Towel",
    "description": "Home Things to Do Pittsburgh Sports Teams History of the Terrible Towel History of the Terrible Towel Discover the history of The Terrible Towel of the Pittsburgh Steelers which began with Myron Cope and lives on today. The History of the Luckiest Towel in Sports The Terrible Towel was created by the late Myron Cope , the Pittsburgh Steelers broadcaster who needed a way to excite the team's fans during a 1975 playoff football game against the Baltimore Colts. Cope urged fans to take yellow dish towels to the game and wave them throughout. The stands were filled that day and the Steelers always seemed to complete terrific plays when the towels were waving. The Steelers won, 28-10. The team moved on in the playoffs and for Super Bowl X in January 1976, the Steelers introduced gold towels with the words \"Myron Cope's Terrible Towel\" printed in black. The Steelers went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 21-17, many claiming, \"thanks to the Towel.\" In 1996 Mr. Cope gave the rights to \"Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel\" to the Allegheny Valley School in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis. The school provides care for more than 900 children, adults and senior citizens with mental retardation and physical disabilities. Proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise almost $1.1 million for the school. On Jan. 15, 2005, during the Steelers playoff run at Acrisure Stadium , VisitPittsburgh sponsored the \"World's Largest Terrible Towel Wave,\" reaching millions of Steelers fans around the world, known amongst themselves as \"Steelers Nation.\" The team came back from what appeared to be a sure loss against the New York Jets, winning the game in overtime, 20-17. It appeared that the Towel had done it again. The Steelers went on to host another home game the following week, Jan. 23, 2005, vs. the Patriots. Another massive Terrible Towel Wave was organized but this time the Steelers lost, 41-27. The victors that day went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. But the Steelers didn't give up on the Terrible Towel. On Halloween , Oct. 31, 2005, a special Terrible Towel was created to honor the retired Cope for his 35 years as a Steelers broadcaster and was waved prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field (now named Acrisure Stadium ). A limited edition of 35,000 were made, all with familiar \"Cope-isms\" like \"Yoi!\" By the way, that night, the Steelers won, 20-19. For Super Bowl XL, played on Feb. 5, 2006 in Detroit, a special edition Terrible Towel was created for fans around Steelers Nation to help the team to victory. It worked! The Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10. Sadly, Myron passed away on Feb. 27, 2008 but his legend lives on. For Super Bowl XLIII, Feb. 1, 2009 in Tampa, another towel was produced to mark the occasion. The outcome? Steelers over Arizona, 27-23, to give them an unprecedented six Super Bowl Championships. On Sunday, Jan. 23, 2011, the Steelers not only beat the New York Jets in the AFC Championship to advance to their third Super Bowl in six years, the game was played on what would have been Myron's 82nd birthday. Somehow that just seems so right. Those who knew and loved Myron, friends and fans alike, know he’s somewhere smiling and cheering, \"Here We Go Steelers, Here We Go!\" The Terrible Towels will be out in force Christmas weekend 2022. The Immaculate Reception, the greatest play in NFL history , fittingly celebrates its (black and) golden 50th anniversary with festivities reuniting Steelers legends from that era during a rematch against the Raiders at Acisure Stadium on Dec. 24, 2022.

Tap into sports history at the Senator John Heinz History Center's Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum , the ultimate museum for Pittsburgh sports lovers. Credit | Senator John Heinz History Center Facebook Page Don't Forget to Brush Up On Your Pittsburgh Steelers Trivia What is The Terrible Towel? Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognizable symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Towels can be purchased in stadium or at sports stores around the North Shore. What is the song played during the fourth quarter? When the Steelers need a big stop in the fourth quarter, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Acrisure Stadium. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. What’s the meaning behind the Steelers logo? While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo. Each of the hypocycloids represents one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore and steel scrape is illustrated with blue. Why do Steelers fans chant “Here We Go Steelers?” During games, you'll hear fans chanting \"Here We Go, Steelers!\" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. “Here We Go,” originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. When should I head to a game this season? Take a look at the Steelers’ 2024 schedule here! The Steelers will be playing 9 regular season and 1 preseason game at Acrisure Stadium from August-January this year. Preseason 8/9 Houston Texans 8/17 Buffalo Bills 7 p.m. Regular Season 9/22 Los Angeles Chargers 1 p.m. 9/29 Indianapolis Colts 1 p.m. 10/6 Dallas Cowboys 8:20 p.m. 10/20 New York Jets 8:20 p.m. 10/28 New York Giants 8:16 p.m. 11/17 Baltimore Ravens 1 p.m. 12/8 Cleveland Browns 1 p.m. 12/25 Kansas City Chiefs 1 p.m. TBD Cincinnati Bengals Week 18 More Football Fun to Discover in Pittsburgh About The Steelers Learn more about catching a Steelers game in Pittsburgh.

What follows is two yinzers’ quest to eat their way around PNC Park and recap their favorite finds and flavors. Looking for a comprehensive guide to everything in the park? Check out this blog . Dessert Pierogi and Chicken Biscuit locations Riverwalk Area (Outfield) Our journey begins at the Riverwalk, once a more closed off region of the park and expanded in 2022 into a vibrant collection of new concession areas, seating right along the outfield, selfie spots, kids areas and gigantic Pirates bobbleheads of all-time greats. This revitalization also led to the park infusing this area with authentic Pittsburgh cuisine, partnering with local restaurants to develop next-level ballpark food with Only In Pittsburgh inspiration. Chicken on the Hill (section 144/145) features a menu inspired by Coop de Ville in the Strip District , and Cannonball Burger (section 145/145) features Station in Bloomfield’s creations, transforming this stretch into one of PNC Park’s best food spots. Jared: The chicken biscuit is messy but so worth it. Grab some extra napkins for this bad boy. The biscuit is buttery and flaky, the house pickle adds the acidity this needs and the breaded chicken itself is perfectly fried with just a hint of heat. This is top tier ballpark eating. Courtney: The dessert pierogi from Cannonball Burger are unlike anything else in the park! These pillowy pockets have a great sweet cheese filling that keep you going back for bite-after-bite without being overly sweet. This is such a fun treat to snack on chillier days in the park when you're not feeling ice cream. Bonus Tip: Don’t go back to your seats yet. Enjoy your meal at one of the seats right against the outfield railing for an amazing view of the game while you chow down. Circle the outfield to find all of the new food options for 2024 New Food Roundup (Throughout PNC Park) Looking to try everything new in the park this summer? Me too! Here's a quick recap on where to find everything new this season: Renegade Hot Dog (Section 133 in Pop's Plaza) Pitt Dog and Cheddar and Chive Brat (135 at Deli Dogs) Roasted corn on the cob, birria beef nachos and caramel churros (137 at LowKey Taco) Chicken Biscuit (144 at Coop de Ville) Dessert Pierogi (144 at Cannonball Burger) Jared: My expectations were sky-high after this went viral before the season, and it is absolutely worth the buzz. The pierogis make this visually stunning (it's absolutely a requirement to take photos of every angle before eating) but my favorite elements of this came from the combo of the briny pickles and savory shredded beef and onions. You get some crunch, some snap, some well-developed slow-cooked goodness and a big mouthful of potatoes in each bite - welcome to the pinnacle of ballpark dining. Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? Two Must-Stops: Deli Dogs and Nachoritas in left Deli Dogs and Nachoritas (Left Field) Making our way into left field, two of the newer food options immediately made us stop and load up before we got to our seats. Deli Dogs (section 135) features upscale takes on the classic ballpark hot dog, with high-quality dogs and buns served Chicago, chili and other styles. Nachoritas (section 137) again elevates the simple nachos and cheese we love and adding queso, crema and now even birria to elevate the experience. Jared: Who knew eating corn at the ballpark would be this good? The elote from Nachoritas might seriously be my favorite food in the ballpark now. The crisp snap of the corn combined with the cotija cheese with a nice kick from the crema, and that's the best bite anywhere. Courtney: Ok, this Pitt Dog from Deli Dogs is straight 🔥. I'm loving the heat from the cap and the crunch from the coleslaw and fried onions. Perfection. Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Fathead's and Cinderlands are the spots to find local drafts Local Beer (Center Field and Left Field Rotunda) Watching pitchers warm up is always fun at PNC Park, but there was never anywhere to sit. Enter the Bullpen Tap Bar , which offers eight of local brewer Fat Head's signature beers on tap along with a rotating selection of other breweries such as North County, Cinderlands Beer Co and even Threadbare Cider. Seats are available on the railing overlooking the bullpen, making this a perfect way to pass a few later innings. Walk-Thru Bru locations throughout the park let you pick a can (Cinderlands and Iron City were available in every cooler I saw) but the true gem is right under the left field rotunda near Section 133, where Cinderlands is set up with drafts and cans you won't find anywhere else in the park. Courtney: I think it’s awesome that the Pirates are doing their part to promote local breweries, and Fat Head’s has plenty of awesome selections. My favorite is this Lime Feein’ Good Mexican-Style lager. Jared: The Cinderlands Corner Bar is my hidden gem of the entire park. It's the perfect mix of IPAs and other lighter beers that pair perfect with ballgame weather, and there's almost never a line. Brain freeze here Something Sweet For those of us with a sweet tooth, the cookie sundae is the best dessert option in the park. You can find it at the Sweet Spot (section 106) or The Cookie & Creamery (section 119) in the infield concourse. Every ice cream/cookie combination goes great with each other, especially during a hot afternoon game, and comes served in a Pirates batting helmet. Healthy Options Error. This is not that type of article. Seriously though, there’s some fresh, innovative salads at the Market behind home plate, but the only vegetables we touched were the celery than came with the wings. Primanti's and Manny's locations Don't Forget the Classics We were stuffed after our culinary tour, but it’s still worth mentioning a few other spots for great grub in the park. Grab some Only In Pittsburgh Primanti Bros. sandwiches, piled high with coleslaw and french fries, located behind section 108. My personal PNC Park tradition is to always make sure I stop by Manny’s (also sporting a newly-designed space) in left field, where you can often find Pirates great Manny Sanguillén seated near the end of the line, who is happy to chat with fans and relive some of his greatest moments.

Speaking of treats...eating at PNC Park is a culinary adventure ! It's part of the whole ballgame experience . Here are some suggestions that go beyond peanuts and cracker jacks, AND check out some of our favorite ballgame traditions here . NEW FOR 2024 Hot Dogs & Wursts Galore 🌭 PNC Park has gone all in on the ballpark staple with three new upscale versions of this easy-to-eat snack all available at different locations. The Renegade Hot Dog (Section 133: order it at the kiosks in Pop's Plaza with the Cannonball Burger and crab fries ) is going to be an instant Yinzer classic: this footlong is piled with pot roast, mini pierogi, pickles and onions for a fantastic taste of Pittsburgh's food passion contained in a single bite. Other new additions here including the Pitt Dog (Section 135) that's topped with capicola, vinegar slaw and provolone cheese from the popular Deli Dogs stand, and an amazing looking cheddar and chive brat with classic toppings of peppers, onions and mustard. Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? Pictured | The Renegade Dog: Maybe the most perfect hot dog ever created? More From Local Restaurants 🌽 It's corn! LowKey Taco (Section 138) continues to expand their menu offerings this year at their Nachorita stand, adding roasted corn on the cob (such a great addition to snack on as you watch the game), birria beef nachos and even some sweet caramel churros to make this stand a must-stop in 2024. Keep walking around the outfield to Section 144 and find Coop de Ville's all-new chicken biscuit ! This is already my go-to stop in the stadium, but adding on a flaky biscuit and house pickles to their already incredible chicken is going to be even better. Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Pictured | Turns out street corn is the optimal ballpark snack Dessert Pierogi? Dessert Pierogi! 🍨 🥟 Yeah, you read that right. Cannonball Burger (Section 146) is adding a sweet version of this Pittsburgh staple, starting with sweet cheese stuffed dumplings and smothering them in chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. If it's a hit, expect sweet pierogi to start popping up all over the city! PNC PARK FAVORITES Manny's BBQ Left Field This newly remodeled barbecue stand is named after former Pirates catcher Manny Sanguillen , who has been known to hang around and sign autographs for fans. Eagle-eyed snack connoisseurs will note the new addition of the topped Mrs. T's mini pierogis you can get with either BBQ pork or chicken On the menu : house smoked BBQ pork and chicken, mac n cheese, topped mini pierogis, slaw Chicken on the Hill & Cannonball Burger Right Field Two local Pittsburgh restaurants ( Coop De Ville and Station ) helped inspire the menus at these spots, and both are located right near seats and tables along the outfield wall to sit and enjoy your meal. On the menu : Nashville hot chicken sandwich, double ranch burgers, big mozz cheese sticks, plant burgers Pop's Plaza Section 132 Be sure to take advantage of all the new improvements in this section of the ballpark. The tech here allows you to get everything delicious here in one place, with kiosks to order from one central location and get your crab fries, ballpark burgers and more. On the menu: Chickie's & Pete's Crabfries (get extra cheese, dipping these things gets addictive), burgers View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chickie's & Pete's (@chickiesandpetes) Primanti Bros. Section 108 You can't go wrong with a Primanti 's sandwich piled high with fresh deli meats and cheeses and topped off with French fries and cole slaw. A true Pittsburgh classic. Just around the corner from this booth is Wings & Things by Caliente, another regional favorite selling buckets of fresh wings and boneless wings. First-timers read this : The Pitts-Burger is the go-to order here, which will be a ground beef patty, coleslaw and fries all piled on freshly-baked white bread. Fat Head's Bullpen Bar Center Field It's easy to find good beer throughout the park (North Country's Fireman's Red is my go-to during game day), but the Bullpen Bar specifically features the flavors brewed right here in the city including rotating favorites from Threadbare, Cinderlands, Aslin and other top-notch pours. The Market Section 118 (Home Plate) Try something on the healthier side at this grab-and-go space. The quinoa salad is a filling and delicious alternative to hot dogs and loaded with peppers, tomatoes and a balsamic dressing. On the menu: Grab-n-go salads, vegan bruschetta wrap Deli Dogs & Nachoritas Sections 135 and 137 For me, hot dogs are the quintessential ballpark food. Find the best in the park as you head to the bottom of the rotunda in left field and head towards center field. On the menu : chili, classic and Chicago-style dogs inspired by local Smallman Street Deli Sweet Spot Behind Section 106 Treat yourself to a helmet cookie sundae, served just as it says with a fresh baked cookie on top of ice cream in a souvenir helmet sundae bowl. No Pittsburgh home is complete without a few of these on hand. Caliente Pizza Sections 113-114, 123, 313, 304 Already a fan favorite at other Pittsburgh stadiums, Caliente Pizza & Draft House is serving up giant slices of Sicilian, pepperoni and cheese pizza to fans at PNC Park. Find them throughout the ballpark at concessions sections in sections 113-114, 123, 313 and 304. Plus, they also now run the Wings & Things stand next to Primantis for your fix of giant buckets of mouthwatering wings. Cinderlands Corner Bar Bottom of the left field rotunda Easily the best kept secret in the park right now, but one I'm happy to share. Head to the bottom of the left field rotunda, keep walking around to the back of the structure and grab the best beer in the park direct from Cinderlands. Cans Available: Raise It, Squish, Lil Cinder Lime, Full Squish If these aren't enough for you, check out these unique offerings at PNC Park , or head to a ball game soon for great baseball and a smorgasbord of food choices!

But what if I told you one of the best nights out in the city happens in a stadium on the south side of the city, complete with scenic views, exciting games and a friendly, high-energy atmosphere? Enter the Pittsburgh Riverhounds , the city's professional soccer team. Before you exit the blog and try to tell me soccer is boring, hear me out. The Hounds (as they're affectionately known) play playoff caliber soccer on the pitch, but the entire game experience from tailgating to after-the-game activities are geared to keep adults and kids happy. Follow along with my Insider's Guide to the Hounds for my tips on what's new for the 2024 season, the best places to sit, the food to grab and some info you'll only be able to find in this blog. I've been following the Riverhounds for years, and can confidently say that your ticket to the game is one of the best values in sports anywhere in the country. What's New for 2024 Something that keeps me coming back to the Hounds every year is that there's always something new and exciting happening for games so that no two evenings are alike. Here's just a few highlights of the promotions happening in 2024 : Pittsburgh Celebrity Appearances - May 18 (Michael Winslow from Space Balls ), July 6 (Hacksaw Jim Duggan from pro wrestling) and Oct. 12 (Judith O'Dea from Night of the Living Dead ). Keep an eye on social for more details as these are announced. Giveaways nights March 16 (mini-banner and thundersticks), June 1 (Kenardo Forbes bobblehead), May 4 (Amo squish), July 13 (Hounds Mount Rushmore) and Oct. 12 (puzzle mosaic). Halftime Shows are coming to Highmark Stadium! See Loop Rawlins April 6, Zooperstars July 27, magician/ventriloquist Aug. 10, and Chainsaw Juggling (yes, you read that right) on Sept. 7 The return of even more pre-match $1 beer nights - April 27, July 20 and Sept. 28. Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Credit | Chris Cowger A New Look for 2024 I've collected a number of Hounds t-shirts and jerseys throughout the year, but the new kit for 2024 was an automatic must-buy. Pictured here are the all-new home kit, fittingly called the Three Rivers and emblazoned with an iconic gold bridge with a design I've not seen from any other sports team. The away kit, called Steel, is no less striking with a gold base design and grey accents. Fans can grab these exclusive new fits from apparel experts Charly online . Affordable Family Fun Between the concessions, tickets and merch, going to a sporting event lately can quickly become expensive. Thankfully, there's no $18 cotton candy at Highmark Stadium. The Riverhounds make every effort to keep the cost of tickets and concessions low, making this sport accessible for fans to see live. Single game tickets start at $20 and parking is cheap and plentiful at lots and garages on that side of the city. This year, fans can even pre-pay for parking passes in the main lot to take all the stress out of game day. Let's talk atmosphere. Hounds games are programmed with kids in mind, and the fan experience is equally accommodating. You'll be sitting next to other families, local soccer teams and fellow fans, so kids are always welcome here! While there's a lot of cheering, the vibe is positive and even the other team's fans are here to have a good time. There's plenty for kids to do at the stadium, too, even if they aren't as into the game. Head to the area behind the Supporters section to kick a soccer ball around with new friends and jump around in a bounce house to get out some energy. After the final whistle, stick around for the post-game autograph session when kids can meet their favorite players or just run around on the field. Photo Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds What to Eat and Drink If you've read my other sports blogs , you know my top concern for any sporting event is what I'm going to eat. Luckily, the Riverhounds understand what their fans want and provide a ton of tasty options that won't break the bank. New for 2024: Highmark Stadium is now the first in Pittsburgh to carry Crumbl Cookies! Check out the Tailgate Zone and Kid Zone for Oreo crumb cake, milk chocolate chip, confetti and snickerdoodle! Also new for this year is the addition of Stateside Vodka products including their refreshing Surfside seltzers. Even better, the fan fave pizza logs are now on the menu full-time. You'll also find conventional concession stand items at stands dotted around the stadium, but keep a special eye out for: Rotating food trucks before the game in their Tailgate Zone offering fresh flavors of the Burgh Burger and nacho specials that rotate throughout the season (March specials include the Irish whiskey bacon burger and corned beef nachos) Gluten-free vegan wraps, grilled chicken wraps and veggie wraps The Family Fun Zone concession stand that lets you grab popcorn, cotton candy and other kid staples quickly without missing a minute of the action. Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Credit | Chris Cowger Where to Sit I know people like to say this old cliché, but there's truly not a bad seat in the house at Highmark Stadium . The best viewing experience is sitting as close to the middle of the field and as high up as possible, giving you the best view of not only the game but also the city as trains buzz past and let out a friendly puff of steam midgame. If your love of the beautiful game can't be contained, you'll find your outlet in the Supporters Section . This high-energy end of the stadium is where the Steel Army resides, drumming, leading chants throughout the game and setting off smoke during the frenzy of a goal celebration. My kids now demand that we sit there for every game and yell and laugh along. Want to bring a group ? I've had a blast with bachelor parties and work events in their club suites and the party deck, but the top option here is the I.C. Light Corner Kick Suite. This shipping container-turned-luxury suite gives up to 40 guests seats right on the field just feet from the action, and the viewing deck on top of the Box is the most unique view in pro sports. Tickets The Hounds make it easy to get tickets online , at the box office or at 412-865-GOAL for single games, season tickets and other options. My only recommendation here is that if you plan on going to several games this year, grab their flexbook . You get 11 tickets for the price of 10 and can use them however you want per game, whether you end up going solo or bringing the whole fam. Photo Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Join the Steel Army We all cheer for the yellow soccer team / The yellow soccer team / The yellow soccer team. Steel Army chant Ready to become a true superfan of the Hounds? Consider joining the Steel Army , the independent supporters group for the team! This group not only brings the energy to the home games and tail gates, but helps organize trips and watch parties for the rest of the schedule. What I love about the Steel Army is how welcoming they are for new members. Feel free to walk right into their tailgate and say hello, and within five minutes you'll have a burger in hand and have met five new friends. Photo Courtesy: Pittsburgh Riverhounds Things to Do Nearby The fun doesn't stop when the game is over. It's easy to make a trip to see the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium into an all-day trip. The stadium is located right at the edge of Station Square, a 1.2 mile stretch of great dining and inventive ways to explore the city. Take an ebike tour of the city with Adam Solar Rides or see the Square via horse drawn carriage at Mike's Carriage Service . Station Square is also home to the Mon Incline and the Gateway Clipper, two of the most iconic ways to take in the city via funicular and riverboat. Got some insider info to share? Want to meet me for a pint at the game? Shoot me an email or come say hello in the Supporters Section as Pittsburgh becomes #Houndtahn every home game.

Rugby with Battle Axes. Human Demolition Derby. There's nothing like armored combat Are you ever just mindlessly scrolling through your social media when something makes you stop and gasp in wonder? That was my experience when I saw a video from Pittsburgh Armored Combat with axes and bodies flying as crowds roared in approval. I had to know more, so I instantly reached out to Chris Sanner, who heads up the combat sport in Pittsburgh, and entered a kingdom I never expected. Shine up your armor, grab your sword and give your best war cry as we delve into this hard-hitting phenomenon. Before I describe it, I think it's best to simply watch a bit from the video below: Your Armored Combat Primer If you're wondering exactly what you just watched, that's okay, so was I at first! Pittsburgh Armored Combat is best described as Medieval MMA, where fighters don gleaming armor and blunted weapons to do real battle inside a cage or similar enclosed structure. This isn't WWE or the local ren fair, the armor is real and these combatants are full-contact fighting for glory as they attack, grapple, throw and go for takedowns. The fights you'll see in Pittsburgh can vary. One-on-one battles have weight classes, a time limit and scoring system, similar to rounds in other combat sports, as fighters rack up points for edge strikes with their weapon, disarming their opponent and taking them to the ground. Then, there's team fighting. Instead of points, these melees are last person standing affairs as our heroes take their opposition to the dirt by any means necessary. There's no weight classes in team fights, leading to inventive matchups as quicker fighters try to outwit their taller adversaries or team up for takedowns. Bodies are flying around the cage as dogpiles, individual duels and jumps make for a fracas accentuated with by loud clangs of metal on metal and a rapt audience responding to every elimination. The Armor, the History and the Resurgence Now that you understand the sport a bit more, it's fun to delve into the details, starting with the armor you're seeing in these photos and videos. You can't get this equipment off of Amazon. Instead, armor and helmets are custom made by expert armorsmiths in the Ukraine or Russia for each fighter. The full armor set weighs anywhere from 50-80 lbs, making every aerial and acrobatic move all the more impressive. Medieval tournament fighting is a 900-year-old sport and operates largely the same today as it did back then. Fighters aren't trying to hurt or maim their opponents, this is a display of skill and respect as well as combat prowess, which leads to a very healthy community that has caused armored combat to thrive as a sport. Affectionately described as rugby with battle axes by Sanner, armored combat started surging in popularity after the Knight Fight television show debuted on the the History Channel. Since then, the tournament scene has blown up with tournaments almost every weekend culminating in Carolina Carnage, their Super Bowl with 400 fighters looking to be crowned champions on a national stage. Celebrities have taken note too, with Arnold Schwarzenegger showing a special interest in the sport and actor Tom Hardy even donning the armor to fight. Bringing the Action to Pittsburgh Chris Sanner of Pittsburgh Armored Combat was always into combat sports, practicing martial arts, boxing and jiu jitsu, as well as interests in Dungeons & Dragons, history and video games. But in 2019, he was watching the aforementioned Knight Fight tv show when everything changed as he saw all of his personal interests come together. \"My first reaction was 'is this real,'\" said Sanner. \"It looked like human demolition derby.\" Unfortunately for Sanner, he could only find one active fighter in Pittsburgh at the time and was similarly slowed by the pandemic. But much like a brave tale of old, Sanner soldiered on and established himself as a well-known fighter while building a cadre of fellow fighters. Not only is it fun to don armor and swing an axe at people, but Sanner also emphasizes what makes this so appealing for fighters. \"This is something I do because it has a positive impact on the people I train with. Armored combat keeps people interested more than the gym, it helps with mental health, it helps with weight loss and it gives you martial arts training all in one sport.\" Trained and battle-hardened, Sanner and his knights are now bringing Pittsburgh Armored Combat to the people of Pittsburgh. Where to See Pittsburgh Armored Combat Sanner's group puts on live events throughout the city with fight cards brimming with group battles and individual duels to ever-growing crowds. Their next event is Sept. 2, 2023 at The Waterfront. This event is free, so it's an awesome day to head down on Labor Day Weekend to shop, see a movie and cheer on these skilled combatants. If you're reading this afterwards, check out their Facebook page which is always updated with upcoming events. Or, if you're ready to become a fighter yourself, send Chris an email to get started. I hope to see you cheering alongside me at the next Pittsburgh Armored Combat competition as we can see, in my favorite quote from A Knight's Tale , who is weighed, who is measured and who is found wanting.

Pittsburgh's biggest baseball legend is Roberto Clemente and his impact on baseball and on Pittsburgh still remain. The Pittsburgh Pirates celebrate Roberto Clemente Day away at the Mets Sept. 15, 2022. In 2023, all 30 MLB teams will play on Roberto Clemente Day Sept. 15, 2023, including the Pirates hosting the Yankees at PNC Park . Twenty-One. To some this is just a number. To Pittsburgh and the baseball community, that number is a legacy. On any given day you can walk down the street and see people sporting the number 21 on their backs, from kids to Moms, Dads, Grandpas and Grandmas. It is a Pittsburgh tradition: The famous Pirates Right Fielder Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker wore the number 21. 50th Anniversary of Clemente's 3000th Hit 2022 is a massive year Clemente's legacy. The city of Pittsburgh, Major League Baseball and his home country of Puerto Rico will all celebrate the 50th anniversary of Clemente's 3,000th hit with celebrations, special exhibits, statues, films and more. In the city, make plans to visit The Clemente Museum now through the end of the year for a brand new display. As soon as you enter, you'll see a giant scoreboard commemorating this iconic moment, with a video showing the hit flanked by gigantic photos taken by the two photographers covering the game that day. Insider Tip: Take special note of the rightmost bat laying on the baseball diamond to the left of the exhibit. That's the legendary bat Clemente used for this tremendous achievement. On Thursday, Sept. 8, the Clemente Museum will also host their Annual Fundraiser . Support the amazing work this museum does for the Pittsburgh community through your donations and look for limited edition bottles from Engine House 25 Wine, exclusive auctions and more great ways to contribute. Also worth checking out is Roberto Clemente: Keeping the Dream Alive , a new feature and documentary from TribLive about the challenges facing Clemente's legacy and the importance of his impact generationally in Puerto Rico. Roberto Clemente's History Clemente was born in Puerto Rico, and was the youngest of his seven siblings. He developed an interest for baseball during his youth when playing ball with neighboring kids. His love and talent for the sport led him to be recruited to play softball with the Sello Rojo team playing shortstop. By the young age of 16 he was already playing in Puerto Rico's amateur league. He began his professional career when he signed with the Cangrejeros de Santurce in 1952, during the season the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract with one of their Triple-A affiliates. So began his famous American baseball career. He moved to Montreal to play with the Royals. At the time, he barely spoke any English and was assisted by infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black. Clemente and the Pittsburgh Pirates He finally debuted on the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 17th, 1955. At first, he didn't sport the famous 21. He wore the number 13. When it came time to change his number, he picked 21 because there are 21 letters in his full name: 'Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker'. In the 1960 season Clemente led the league in batting averages and led the Pirates to a 95-59 record year, winning the NL pennant. He and his teammates defeated the New York Yankees in a long seven game series, Clemente with a batting average of .310. He earned a sport on the NL All-Star roster after his performance. Then came the 1970 season, the last year of baseball that would ever be played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium. In the final game at the field on June 28th, 1970, Clemente felt very emotional about the moving of stadiums, stating that \"I spent half my life there.\" To honor Clemente the Pirates declared July 24, 1970 as \"Roberto Clemente Night\". Tons of his Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium wearing their Clemente gear. The Pirates held a ceremony where Clemente received a scroll of 300,000 signatures from Puerto Rico with thousands of dollars being donated to charity work, at the request of Roberto Clemente. This season the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were eventually eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. The following season, Clemente lead the Prates to another World Series beating the Orioles. He received the World Series' Most Valuable Player Award after his amazing efforts. In Clemente's final baseball season of his life he recorded his 3,000th hit in the 4th inning of the September 30th, 1972 game against the New York Mets. This would be his last regular season at-bat hit. His final game was October 11th, 1972 against the Cincinnati Red's. Why Pittsburgh Loves Roberto Clemente Clemente was not only known for his baseball talent, he was also known for giving back to the community. He was very involved in delivering relief packages to to the people of Managua, Nicaragua after they were affected by a earthquake. Clemente learned that some of the aid packages weren't making it to the victims so he accompanied the team to Nicaragua on the 4th relief flight on New Years Eve. The plane crashed due to mechanical errors, and Roberto Clemente and the four others on the plane died. The baseball world was forever changed. Clemente is honored all throughout Pittsburgh. A bridge is named after him, PNC Park has a statue dedicated to him, and there is a Roberto Clemente Museum. The Pirates and Major League Baseball do so much to honor this national hero. They have an award named after him \"The Clemente Award\" that is presented to the player who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, and community involvement\". Roberto Clemente not only shaped the game of baseball, he shaped Pittsburgh and Puerto Rico. He supported his Latino community and Pittsburgh community with full efforts. Five Ways to Celebrate Roberto Clemente in Pittsburgh: Visit the Roberto Clemente Museum and indulge in some \"Clemente Label\" wine Take a stroll across the Roberto Clemente Bridge Catch a Pirates game and grab a photo with the Roberto Clemente Statue outside of PNC Park Experience the \"Beat 'Em Bucs\" exhibit at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center Pick Roberto Clemente out of a lineup of the \" Legends of Pittsburgh \", a mural highlighting the 'Burgh's all time best baseball players.

My first impression was shock at just how massive the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is. Guests enter via the B Suite gates right next to the Pro Shop, and the stage is set by a stadium seating hype video before turning guests loose into the museum proper. Long corridors twist and turn through rare artifacts, many on display for the first time, as well as retellings and recreations of the biggest moments of the team. Here's just a few reasons why this museum is a must-see Only in Pittsburgh attraction. A Complete Steelers History When you have a team this storied and with so many accolades, I think it would've been easy for the Steelers to focus on the 70s and 2000s eras only. What I absolutely loved about the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, however, is that is paints a complete picture of the Steelers franchise that lets guests truly understand the team. The very first panel you'll see in the museum harkens back to football history, noting that the first professional football game was played in Latrobe (hey, that's my hometown!), just a short drive from Pittsburgh. You'll see the struggles of the early teams, the impact of World War II on the rosters and the difficulties Art Rooney had to overcome. In the end, experiencing so much history about non-championship seasons made me appreciate those Ws even more. The Hall of Honor Museum is a celebration of all things Steelers, not just the Lombardi trophies, and show the tireless efforts of the Rooneys, coaches and players who led this team to the Super Bowl again and again. Jump, Cheer and Yell with Interactive Exhibits With three energetic kids, a stuffy, quiet museum is not an option. Luckily, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is family-friendly and perfect for even the most boisterous fans on game day. Interactive displays let guests select the era they're interested in, scroll timelines of important events and re-live impactful moments like one section dedicated entirely to the Immaculate Reception. Think you can outdo Myron Cope? Enter the broadcast booth and pick a classic play which you can then do commentary on! At the end, the display plays back video and audio of how you did, which is sure to bring lots of laughs. Near the end of the Museum, interactive displays let you measure up to the Steelers, encouraging you to run out of the entrance tunnel and jump as high as you can just like you're taking the field at Acrisure to a raucous crowd. Honoring Steelers Legends After you're done viewing all six Super Bowl rings, the final part of the exhibit is perhaps the true highlight. A massive wall of bronzed footballs enshrines each member of the Hall of Honor, with multiple displays that let you select a person, scroll through a timeline of their life and play videos of some of their most memorable moments. Diehard Steelers fans, you can easily spend an hour or two just in this room. With new members added yearly (and hopefully a new Super Bowl ring to add soon), there's a new reason to tour the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum each season. Plan Your Visit Ready to tour? The Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is open Wednesday-Monday from 11 a.m.-4 p.m. and passes can be booked online . Tours happen on the hour and the last tour of the day begins at 3 p.m. Please Note: The museum will be closed on University of Pittsburgh home games.

When you play and win for the Steelers, you are celebrated for life. We're taking a look at some of the recent inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, who is on the horizon with Hall of Fame ambitions and the full list of Steelers Hall of Famers below. You can celebrate these Pro Football Hall of Famers and other Pittsburgh greats in the City of Champions all year long . The Steelers recently opened their own Hall of Honor to recognize all the great contributors to this historic franchise. From the Immaculate Reception monument and photo ops with The Chief outside Acrisure Stadium to a visit to the Western PA Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center , there is no shortage of ways to experience Steelers history in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Football Hall of Fame Inductees 2021 Class: Five members of the Pittsburgh Steelers were enshrined at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021. Pittsburgh legends Bill Cowher, Donnie Shell and Troy Polamalu were honored with the Centennial Class of 2020. Alan Faneca and Bill Nunn were honored with the 2021 class. The celebrations took place at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio. Alan Faneca joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1998 and enjoyed a 206-game career in the three rivers city. Faneca started 14 playoff games, including four AFC championship games and a Steelers victory in Super Bowl XL. One of the best offensive linemen in franchise history, Faneca was a six-time, first-team All-Pro during his years with the Steelers; he was voted to nine Pro Bowls overall. Legendary journalist and Steelers scout Bill Nunn was recognized with a video tribute as the first Black Contributor in the 100-year history of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Nunn served 18 years as Pittsburgh’s assistant personnel director, then 23 years as a semiretired scout. Nunn also was inducted into the Black College Hall of Fame in 2010. 2020 Class: Pittsburgh native Bill Cowher was the head coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for 15 seasons from 1992 to 2006. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Steelers became the first team ever to win nine road games and the first sixth-seeded team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl, defeating the Seattle Seahawks, 21-10, in Super Bowl XL. Donnie Shell joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1974 as a free agent. Shell capped his career with 51 interceptions, becoming the first strong safety in the history of the National Football League to surpass the 50-interception mark. His 51 career interceptions rank him third in Steelers history behind Hall of Famer Mel Blount (57) and Jack Butler (52). Troy Polamalu spent his entire 12-year professional football career with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Polamalu was a defensive leader who guided the Steelers to seven playoff appearances, five division titles and helped them win two of their three most-recent Super Bowl appearances – XL and XLIII.

He was the Steelers starting QB, and the face of a historic franchise, for 18 years. He’s threw for over 63,000 yards and 417 touchdowns. His overall record is 165-81-1 and he’s been in six Pro Bowls. Steelers fans’ favorite Ben stat? He won two Super Bowls. He will be eligible for the HOF in 2027 and has a shot at getting in on his first try. Maurkice Pouncey: Big Ben’s right-hand man, Center Maurkice Pouncey made the 2010s All-Decade Team. He is a 9x Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro selection. He'll be eligible for the HOF starting in 2026. Art Rooney Jr. and Buddy Parker: Both were finalists in the 2023 class. Rooney Jr. has been with the Steelers from 1965 to this day. He was the Steelers Personnel Director until 1985 and played a pivotal rule in crafting the Steelers 70s Super Bowl winning teams. Parker coached the Steelers, Detroit Lions, and Chicago Cardinals from 1949-1964. His career record was 104-75-9. Hines Ward: Hines has been knocking on the door for a few years now. Although he doesn’t have many individual accolades, he does have a huge list of intangibles as well as two Super Bowl rings and a Super Bowl MVP to his name. James Harrison: The fan-favorite OLB was the 2008 NFL Defensive Player of the year. He is also a five-time Pro Bowler, four-time All-Pro, and of course, has two Super Bowl Rings. Mike Tomlin: Tomlin has built up a coaching resume that is as impressive as his predecessors Bill Cowher and Chuck Noll. Going into the 2024 season, he is now the longest tenured head coach in the NFL, and amazingly still doesn’t have a losing season. He is a Super Bowl champion and has a great overall record of 173-100-2. Although he is probably far from retirement, he already has a Hall of Fame coaching resume at the age of 52. T.J. Watt: Watt is only 29, but you can't deny these stats: six-time Pro Bowler, three-time league leader in sacks and two-time league leader in tackles for loss and the Defensive Player of the Year in 2021. A few more seasons of this pedigree and Canton is going to be adding some more black and gold very soon. TJ Watt coming out of the entrance tunnel.

Whether you're visiting from out-of-town or you're a local with season tickets, check out our Pittsburgh guide especially for football fans! Credit | Dustin McGrew Experience Steelers History Explore 90 years of Steelers history at the newly opened Steelers Hall of Honor Museum , located near the B Suite gate at Acrisure Stadium . This 10,000-square-foot exhibit walks visitors through every decade of Steelers history with never-before-seen artifacts and interactive exhibits that let you become part of Steelers history. Steelers Hall of Honor Museum Or, tackle your way through Pittsburgh football history at the Senator John Heinz History Center's Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum ! Relive iconic Pittsburgh moments such as the Immaculate Reception, try on a Super Bowl ring, learn more about Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel and take a picture with the Terrible Fan. Featuring more than 70 interactive exhibits, this is the ultimate museum for any sports lover. Sports Museum at Heinz History Center Credit | Jody Mader Go Behind The Scenes Experience Steelers football up-close during an Acrisure Stadium Tour . The tours take fans on-field, in the locker rooms, through the Great Hall, including the Hall of Honor, and more.

Acrisure Stadium tour Credit | Matt Shuck Get Some Gear Need some new Steelers gear? Take a trip to Pittsburgh's authentic Strip District neighborhood for any and everything Steelers. Yinzers in the Burgh is a notable Pittsburgh sports store, filled with everything from Steelers onesies to a huge variety of Terrible Towels, Steelers hats, cold weather gear, jerseys and so much more. You can also find street vendors that sell various low-cost black and gold apparel. Looking for more general black-and-gold apparel? Check out these local shops: Steel City 412 Love, Pittsburgh Commonwealth Press Photo Credit: Yinzers in the Burgh Facebook Page Take the Burgh Bus All the fun of making jokes about Cleveland, on wheels! Join comedian Matt Light on the Burgh Bus as you tailgate through distinct Pittsburgh neighborhoods, wave your Terrible Towel, compete at Pittsburgh trivia and much more on this truly one-of-a-kind tour. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Burgh Bus (@burghbus) Ride The Incline and Walk Around The Point Have a day or two to kill before the game? Come visit these spots. Both attractions are often featured during NFL broadcasts of home Steelers games. The Duquesne Incline specifically has a great view of Pittsburgh during the fall and winter months. The Point is a go-to walk to take in pretty much anything you can see downtown, and it's an easy walk from there, over the bridge and into our North Shore where the Steelers play! Catch Other Pittsburgh Sports Not only does Pittsburgh come to life on Steelers Sundays, but our passionate fan base also brings that same energy to other teams throughout the city. In September (and hopefully October) the Pittsburgh Pirates season overlaps with the Steelers, making it possible to see both teams in a weekend at two world-renowned stadiums . The same is true across two rivers at Highmark Stadium to support the Pittsburgh Riverhounds pro soccer team! From mid-October on, the Pittsburgh Penguins NHL team also plays in our Uptown neighborhood at PPG Paints Arena. Or, check out the Pitt Panthers who also play at Acrisure in ACC action! Pro Tip: Look at all our sports team schedules before you visit to see who else might be able to see while you're in town! Head Under our Friday Night Lights If you live and breathe football, you're in luck. Pittsburgh and the surrounding region is a hotbed of high school football activity, with powerhouse teams, NFL Draft-caliber talent and rivalries that pack the stadium. Find schedules of our games on local news sites or through the WPIAL to see our own Friday Night Lights. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Aaron Caldwell (@aac_creative) Go On a Brew Tour Beer and football have always went hand-in-hand, but if you're in town for a Steelers game you're also lucky enough to be in one of the top craft beer cities in the country. Follow the Pittsburgh Brewers Guild for pre-made trails that let you explore a unique neighborhood and sampling their best suds. I'd recommend starting with their North Shore Trail, which allows you to sip six of my favorite brews all throughout our stadium district where the Steelers play. North Shore Trail courtesy of the Pittsburgh Breweries website If you have time to venture outside of the city, book a tour at Pittsburgh Brewing Co. , the home of I.C. Light and Iron City Beer, for a behind-the-scenes tour of this AI-enhanced, state-of-the-art brewery. A beautiful sight as IC Light is canned, boxed and shipped right in front of you. Eat Like a Local Food is serious business in Pittsburgh. We love our regional delicacies from pierogis and french fry-filled sandwiches to gobs and chipped ham. As our city grew and populations shifted, you can now find international cuisine, fine dining and Pittsburgh staples all on the same street. My favorite way to enjoy all of our local favorites combines both our dining scene and the Steelers. Follow our guide to the Strip District and walk around to our various markets and restaurants (and don't forget some local beer), then bring your bounty to the lots outside Acrisure Stadium for the ultimate tailgate. Visit The Great One While Pittsburgh is no stranger to hall of famers and all stars, we have an entire museum dedicated to Roberto Clemente, housed in a historic firehouse and full of memorabilia from The Great One himself. Make sure to add on the wine tasting at the Clemente Museum for the full experience and keep an eye out for celebrity gear not just from Clemente but other baseball and Pittsburgh sports legends as you explore. Ok, we've went over the plays and you should have your itinerary in hand. Time to break this huddle. We'll see you out there exploring the city and inside Acrisure Stadium screaming for the black and gold alongside us.

Here are a few must-see stops we suggest adding to your itinerary: ﻿Steelers Hall of Honor Museum Relive 90 years of Steelers history at this incredible interactive experience right at Acrisure Stadium . Opened in 2022, the Steelers Hall of Honor gives fans a one-of-a-kind look at the team. Diehard fans, families and general visitors will all find something new from the 50+ Hall of Honor inductees to calling your own play in the announce booth and more high energy fun as they learn about the team, the players, the coaches and the moments that define them. The Immaculate Reception On Dec. 23, 1972, the Pittsburgh Steelers played their first playoff game in franchise history against the Oakland Raiders. Just as the clock ran out, fullback Franco Harris scooped up the ball and ran for a touchdown that will forever be known as the Immaculate Reception. You can visit the memorial of this historic play in the exact spot where it happened on the site of the old Three Rivers Stadium near Acrisure Stadium. BONUS: If you’re flying into Pittsburgh International Airport, be sure to check out the Franco Harris Immaculate Reception statue for the perfect Pittsburgh photo op, now located in the Landside Terminal (no ticket needed). Immaculate Reception monument - a holy pilgrimage for any non-Raiders football fan Take a Photo with The Chief True Steelers fans know that a trip to Pittsburgh wouldn’t be complete without stopping for a photo with Steelers founder, Art Rooney, Sr. The Chief watches over Acrisure Stadium as a bronze statue holding his trademark cigar and has plenty of room for photos! ﻿Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at Heinz History Center Discover the history behind the Steelers dynasty at the Heinz History Center ! Holding the title of Pennsylvania’s largest History Museum, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum is located on the Heinz History Center’s second and third floors, celebrating Western Pennsylvania’s unsurpassed sports legacy. Do you know what a hypercycloid is? If you know the Steelers logo, you do! Read more about the history of the Steelers logo as documented by the American Iron and Steel Institute.

Find a Seat Hall of Famers A look at the City of Champions' recent honors with Hall of Fame enshrinements and retired numbers. A Tradition of Excellence Steelers Trivia Here are some of our favorite Steelers facts for your next trivia night: Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognized symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Steelers Tip: The Towel is for waving or decorating, not for drying your hands or using for any other towel-like purpose, which is believed to bring back luck. Sometime during the fourth quarter before a big play or series, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Heinz Field. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. The tradition dates back to a 2002 comeback win against the Cleveland Browns. Make sure to visit the FedEx Great Hall inside Heinz Field; it's basically a shrine to the greatest moments in football history with Super Bowl trophies, jerseys, rings and more on display. In Pittsburgh, Big Ben was our 2x Super Bowl-winning quarterback, not a clock. Steelers aren't just inventive in their get-up, we also like to give incredible moments in football nicknames like The Immaculate Reception, The Steel Curtain, and, most recently in honor of six Super Bowl Championships, Sixburgh. While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo . Each of the hypocycloids represent one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore, and steel scrape is illustrated with blue. During games, you'll hear fans chanting \"Here We Go, Steelers!\" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. Here We Go, originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. Having sold more than 120,000 copies of the original, Here We Go is now regularly updated to mention current players' names and has become an anthem for the team during playoffs. Whether you're visiting for a game or just happen to be around the city during football season, you're sure to enjoy the unique Steelers atmosphere. To get a full taste of the football culture here in the 'Burgh, I encourage you head to Acrisure Stadium for a game or at least visit Stage AE for a free tailgate open before, during, and after home games. Plus, you can sign up for Steelers Nation Unite to earn exclusive rewards near and far from Pittsburgh. Here We Go Steelers!

And, ballpark nachos get kicked up a notch by Nachoritas with queso and crema for a satisfying addition. And that's just the beginning! Read our full recap of what to eat section by section of the stadium for a full look at the flavors of PNC Park. PPG Paints Arena When the Pittsburgh Penguins hit the ice at the PPG Paints Arena, there’s no shortage of food for fans to enjoy. Check out the meatballs at Emporio: A Meatball Joint . One of Pittsburgh’s best sushi restaurants, Nakama , has two locations in the arena where fresh rolls and sashimi are made throughout the game.

An order of Doritos Corn Dog Pretzels at Acrisure Stadium , home to the Pittsburgh Steelers , includes two freshly battered corn dogs, coated with crushed Doritos and topped with nacho cheese and scallions, on a bed of Doritos. If you’re craving pizza, check out Franco’s Pizzeria, which features three Steelers’ themed pies: The Immaculate Pie, Gina Margarita & PeppeRooney Pizza. If beer isn’t your preferred beverage, Acrisure Stadium features a diverse wine selection at the North Shore Winery stand. Also worth checking out at Acrisure are the Potato Patch Fries just like Kennywood does 'em (Section 106), Pierogi House for a Pittsburgh staple (Section 119) and the spicy chicken & waffle sandwich (Club seats). Pro Tip: Use the Steelers Official Mobile App to order your next beer or snack so you can skip the line, pick-up by scanning your bar code and be back in your seat before you can say Franco's Italian Army.
