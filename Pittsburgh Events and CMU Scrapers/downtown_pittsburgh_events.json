Its theme of the dark passions between men and women is as gripping—and controversial—as when it first premiered. Tom Borrow, a fast-rising artist of the new generation of virtuoso soloists, debuts with his signature work—Ravel’s terrifically entertaining and jazzy Piano Concerto. Concluding the concert is Sibelius’ darkly atmospheric and gloriously menacing Fourth Symphony.

From a Greek Revival building of 1836, to cast-iron-front structures of the 1870s and 1880s, to a majestic quartet of early-20th-century skyscrapers, the district includes distinguished structures designed by more than a dozen eminent Pittsburgh architects. The tour focuses on the portion of the District once known as “Pittsburgh’s Wall Street” for its concentration of buildings that served the financial and investment industries.

Embodying the range of artistic voices that have shaped chamber music, this program pairs 20th century works by Samuel Barber and Florence Price with a string quintet by Johannes Brahms. Named for M.C. Escher’s method of interplay between individual components working together as a whole, the Escher Quartet is lauded for its “beautiful blend of individuality and accord” (BBC Music Magazine). The Quartet has built a reputation for profound musical insight and rare tonal beauty over nearly two decades performing together. Beyond serving as season artists of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Quartet tours many of the great music halls of America and Europe. Jordan Bak has achieved international acclaim as a trailblazing artist, praised for his radiant stage presence, dynamic interpretations, and fearless power. Playing with “haunting lyrical grace” (Gramophone), Bak has performed as a soloist with leading orchestras and toured internationally. Bak is “an exciting new voice in Classical performance” (I Care If You Listen), championing new music by composers shaping the field. The Escher Quartet features Adam Barnett-Hart on violin, Brendan Speltz on violin, Pierre LaPointe on viola, and Brook Speltz on cello.

Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005. To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint. The use of cameras is NOT permitted.

In silent-era Hollywood, stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is brought to a hospital after an on-set accident leaves him paralysed. There, he befriends a young girl called Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) and starts telling her a fantastical tale of epic heroes trying to take revenge on an evil ruler - whilst secretly planning his own suicide. He captivates her with this whimsical story that removes her far from the hospital doldrums into the exotic landscapes of her imagination. “Tarsem Singh’s ‘The Fall’ is a mad folly, an extravagant visual orgy, a free-fall from reality into uncharted realms. Surely it is one of the wildest indulgences a director has ever granted himself. Tarsem, for two decades a leading director of music videos and TV commercials, spent millions of his own money to finance ‘The Fall,’ filmed it for four years in 28 countries and has made a movie that you might want to see for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.” —Roger Ebert Directed by Tarsem Singh 2006 | USA, India | English, Romanian, and Latin language with English subtitles | DCP Rated R Contact Us412-566-4190Email Us Pittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222 Share this page",

Heralded as the most important win for labor since the 1930s, this timely documentary captures the Amazon Labor Union’s historic grassroots campaign to unionize thousands of their co-workers from day one of organizing. Led by the charismatic but underestimated Chris Smalls, the diverse band of workers start the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) and embark on a journey against one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. The odds are stacked against them, as the group finds itself up against a tech industry giant with unlimited resources, without major support from national unions or politicians, and while navigating internal divisions within their own ranks. Filmmakers Brett Story and Stephen Maing document the struggle from day one, offering a gripping human drama about the fight for power and dignity in today's globalized economic landscape.

Not Snow White and her posse of disenchanted princesses in the hilarious hit musical that’s anything but Grimm. The original storybook heroines are none-too-happy with the way they’ve been portrayed in today’s pop culture so they’ve tossed their tiaras and have come to life to set the record straight. Forget the princesses you think you know – these royal renegades are here to comically belt out the truth. Received an “Outstanding Off-Broadway Musical” nomination (Outer Critics Circle Awards) and a “Best New Off-Broadway Musical” nomination (Off Broadway Alliance).

    "description": "From world-renowned director F.W Murnau, this classic piece of German cinema demonstrates the limitless possibilities of storytelling. Dare to enter Count Orlok’s castle, where the macabre takes human form and feasts on the innocent! Follow Thomas Hutter as he travels to the secluded Transylvanian castle and witnesses a nightmare come to life in the shape of a vampire! When the Count develops a craving for Hutter’s wife, Hutter must race against the clock to protect her from falling victim to Orlok’s desires. One of the first breakthroughs in gothic horror, Nosferatu’s chilling tale continues to haunt audiences more than a century after its release. For this special screening, local composer and performer Tom Roberts perform live with his own original score for the film. \"It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death.\" - Roger Ebert. About Tom Roberts: Tom Roberts is one of the leading scholars of early jazz piano in the world today (as stated by Ricardo Sciavales in The Heart and Soul of Stride, Blues, and Swing Piano). He has performed on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Statler Brothers Show on TNN, and A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. Tom was pianist for Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks in New York City and pianist and musical director for Leon Redbone for six years. Tom has recorded over 40 compact discs and has performed throughout the United States and Europe. Directed by F.W.

Join us for Faces of Resilience, a transformative two-day workshop at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, where you’ll create powerful masks to express your emotions, celebrate your loved ones, and honor your triumphs. These workshops are offered in partnership with Project Safe Storage and will be facilitated by Tia Baker and Dr. Lois Dabney-Smith. Workshops will be offered in August, September and October. Each workshop is a Saturday and Sunday and will be offered in August (3&4), September (14&15), and October (26&27) from 9am-5pm. The masks will be displayed during Community Day on December 14th, in conjunction with a panel discussion with Community Leaders in the violence prevention space. Why Two Days? ? In-Depth Healing: Healing takes time. Over two days, you’ll have the space to deeply explore and process your emotions, ensuring a more profound and lasting impact. ? Comprehensive Guidance: With extended sessions, our experienced art therapists can provide more thorough guidance, helping you unlock deeper levels of creativity and self-expression. ? Community Building: Two days allow for stronger connections to form within the group, creating a supportive community that understands and shares your journey. ? Reflect & Refine: The second day offers the opportunity to refine and complete your mask, process the weekend’s experiences, and close out with a special ceremony. What Will You Gain? ? Emotional Healing: Through guided mask-making, you’ll find a unique, non-verbal way to process and release deep-seated emotions, paving the way for profound healing. ? Celebrate Loved Ones: Use your art to honor the memories and legacies of those you cherish, creating a beautiful tribute to their impact on your life. ? Empowerment & Resilience: Transform your pain into powerful expressions of resilience, discovering new strengths and pathways to self-discovery and hope. How to Prepare? The masks you create will be actual molds of your face, offering a unique and personal touch to your artistic expression. We recommend that women attend without makeup and all participants wear comfortable clothes that you don’t mind getting paint on to ensure the best experience. Guided Art Sessions: Experienced art therapists will lead you through each step, helping you unlock your creativity and emotions. Supportive Community: Connect with fellow survivors in a safe, understanding environment, sharing, and reflecting on your journey together. Panel Discussion: At the end of the workshop series, some participants will have the opportunity to join community leaders in a panel discussion at the August Wilson Center to discuss the impact of the project and share their experiences. Meals Provided: Enjoy continental breakfast and lunch for both days, ensuring you’re nourished and focused on your healing journey. Special Ceremony: Conclude the workshop with a special ceremony to honor your journey, celebrate your resilience, and reflect on the weekend’s experiences. By the end of this weekend, you’ll leave with: A tangible, artistic expression of your journey and resilience. Newfound connections and support from a community of fellow survivors. The empowerment that comes from reclaiming your narrative and celebrating your loved ones. An opportunity to voice your story and impact the community through a panel discussion.

Hear firsthand accounts from veterans and military families who will share their personal journeys of how military life has shaped their identities and their lives. This program is not just about listening – it’s also about sharing. We encourage attendees to share their stories and unique perspectives on their life experiences. The “Homefront and Frontlines: Women and the Impact of War” program is held in conjunction with the History Center’s new exhibition, A Woman’s Place: How Women Shaped Pittsburgh. The exhibit recognizes that military action and times of conflict have always been a double-edged sword for women, bringing sacrifice and loss but also opportunities for them to learn new skills, demonstrate untapped abilities, and enter previously inaccessible spaces closed to them during peacetime. Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.

    "description": "Join the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust to celebrate Día de Los Muertos with a series of vibrant and meaningful events to honor the beauty of this cultural tradition with food, music, film, and community engagement. Aimed at an international audience—and indeed, it was the first Mexican film to be nominated for an Academy Award, as well as Mexico’s entry in the 1960 Cannes Film Festival—Macario takes the form of a macabre fable about an impoverished peasant (Ignacio López Tarso) who dreams of having enough food to satisfy his constant hunger. Macario’s life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters three mysterious figures representing Death (played by José Gálvez), the Devil (played by Enrique Lucero), and God (played by Pina Pellicer). They offer him a gift: a magical turkey that will grant him three wishes. In exchange, Macario must promise to give the bones of the turkey to Death. P With his newfound ability to fulfill his desires, Macario embarks on a journey filled with moral dilemmas and consequences. He uses his wishes to satisfy his hunger and improve his social status but soon realizes that wealth and power do not bring him true happiness. As he grapples with the consequences of his choices, Macario learns profound lessons about greed, compassion, and the nature of human existence.

Visit at your convenience between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Cost: Free PHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail. Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005. To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint. The use of cameras is NOT permitted. For further information––or to double-check that the Jail Museum will be open on a particular Monday, contact Mary Lu Denny: at marylu@phlf.org or call 412-471-5808, ext. 527.

This 45-minute show encourages children and their parents to unleash their imaginations and sense of humor. Penny Arcade fosters collaboration, listening skills, and silliness for everyone at any age through a hands-on approach to theater. Whether your child is a natural performer or a thoughtful observer, the show adapts to each individual, giving everyone a unique and hilarious experience they’ll talk about for a long time! Penny Arcade is a fun and innovative show you won’t find anywhere else in the city. Important information: Penny Arcade was designed to include activities and subject matter appropriate for kids aged 4 to 8 — the experience is a fun, goofy time for everyone in the room! Through games and activities, guests will learn about the foundations of improv comedy: collaboration, support, and listening. Kids can hop up and interact with the performers, use their imaginations, and get silly. By the end of the show, every guest is a “Penny Player” and has the opportunity to engage with the show and unleash their sense of humor! While we encourage everyone in the room to engage with the production, it’s not a requirement. Children are encouraged to do what’s most comfortable for them. There are moments when everyone will be sitting down watching a live comedy performance, and when we’re all dancing and moving about the space. Quiet rooms will also be available if a family needs to step out and take a break.

Forget everything you’ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music.

Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005.

Set in 1940s Holman, Indiana, the film is Ralphie Parker’s wistful look back at a past Christmas, when he was 9 years old and his only dream was for Santa Claus to bring him an official Red Ryder carbine-action, 200-shot-range, model air rifle. A Christmas Story comes delightfully packaged with iconic comedic moments, sweet nostalgia, and satire. See the gold-trophy-esque glow of the famous leg lamp, the Pepto Bismol-pink of little Ralphie’s bunny suit, and one family’s holiday setbacks and celebrations on Pittsburgh’s largest screen.

    "description": "For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol’s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America’s most loved cereal boxes including Reese’s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol’s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol’s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.

Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005. Cost: Free To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint.

    "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

Visit at your convenience between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Cost: Free PHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail. Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005. To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint. The use of cameras is NOT permitted. For further information––or to double-check that the Jail Museum will be open on a particular Monday, contact Mary Lu Denny: at marylu@phlf.org or call 412-471-5808, ext. 527.

From Bavarian beer halls to the high peaks of the Alps, take a \"Walk on the Wild Side,\" AKA our very own Novemberfest inspired by Strauss's sublime An Alpine Symphony. First, join us for the pre-show party around Heinz Hall. Enjoy a glass of Bavarian beer or a specialty cocktail from the Biergarten, explore music-themed activities, take photos, and mingle with fellow guests before heading into this short (but epic) performance. An Alpine Symphony is a single-movement piece with 22 phases that runs just around 50 minutes. Over 100 musicians are required to bring Strauss's transcendental tone poem to life: a journey through the fierce elements, apparitions, and mysteries of nature. Listen for stormy winds, echoes of thunder in the distance, birdcalls, and a triumphant summit. It's awe-inspiring. You can't help but smile. You'll wish you brought your hiking shoes. Forget everything you’ve heard. Join the PSO at Heinz Hall for one-of-a-kind experiences that take you deeper into the music.

Whether your child is a natural performer or a thoughtful observer, the show adapts to each individual, giving everyone a unique and hilarious experience they’ll talk about for a long time! Penny Arcade is a fun and innovative show you won’t find anywhere else in the city. Important information: Penny Arcade was designed to include activities and subject matter appropriate for kids aged 4 to 8 — the experience is a fun, goofy time for everyone in the room!

Kids can hop up and interact with the performers, use their imaginations, and get silly. By the end of the show, every guest is a “Penny Player” and has the opportunity to engage with the show and unleash their sense of humor! While we encourage everyone in the room to engage with the production, it’s not a requirement. Children are encouraged to do what’s most comfortable for them.

Visit at your convenience between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Cost: Free PHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail. Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum. The Jail Museum, which is located in Downtown— at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219— opened in 2005. To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint. The use of cameras is NOT permitted. For further information––or to double-check that the Jail Museum will be open on a particular Monday, contact Mary Lu Denny: at marylu@phlf.org or call 412-471-5808, ext. 527.

    "description": "For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

    "description": "From skulls to car crashes, both artists deploy their signature bright colors and pop culture references while also presenting the lurid spectacle of death. The dark undercurrents in the work of KAWS and Warhol are magnified and brought into plain sight by presenting the two artists together for the first time. KAWS will also respond to Warhol’s embrace of commercialism by presenting a new series of paintings, sculptures, and installations related to his recent commission with General Mills which inserted his signature characters into the packaging for some of America’s most loved cereal boxes including Reese’s Puffs, Count Chocula, and Boo-Berry. The cereal works will be juxtaposed with Warhol’s iconic Brillo Boxes and his lesser-known series of paintings for children. In response to The Warhol’s new initiative The Pop District, KAWS will also present a monumental wooden sculpture in Pop Park, directly across from the museum and visible from its entrance space.

    "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.

    "description": "For nearly four decades, Kim Bond (b. 1963, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) has explored the intersections of paranormal phenomena and the pursuit of a kinder, more inclusive world through her multidisciplinary practice encompassing drawings, paintings, sculptures, and writings. Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated. Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross’ simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of “no mistakes, only happy accidents” further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond’s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.

    "description": "Wood Street Galleries is pleased to present the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby (b. New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.
